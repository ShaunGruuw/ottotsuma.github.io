<!-- Classes, normal (blue), rare (green), epic (red), Unique (purple), legendary (Orange), growth-type (Seraph(pink)), Quest/inherent (gold).

	(basic classes are the options given when you start, does not have to always be normal type class. Advanced classes are just classes beyond the basic classes, can also be normal type.)

Items follow a similar logic

Races follow no such pattern. Each as benefits and disadvantages of it`s own.

Spells/Skills are on a spheregrid alongside attribute nodes (stat change nodes). They are often blocked (greyed out) until a certain level or criteria is met. Once unlocked a player can dump level points into the node until full. So at level 30 Spells/Skills beyond the basic`s are unlocked up to a cap of 3, So a player can only put a maximum of 3 points into a spell (unless otherwise stated). This happens again at level 80 the cap is raised to 6 and players can now improve the potency/cast time/range/area/etc. Of each of their unlocked skills.

									<h2>Jobs</h2>
									 </header>
									<p>To start all fighters get access to starting skills, these are simple but useful skills, such as charge, battle shout and thrust. These skills like others can be upgraded at a later level, eg. battle shout can become war cry or rally. Fighters have access to fighting energy this is used to active most skills. </p>

									<p>Fighters can pick "jobs" this is reflected in the primary weapon they pick and gives them access to new skills or stat boosts depending on the job. The job`s help decide your advanced class. Below are some of the more common jobs.</p>

								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">
										<span class="icon solid fa-code-branch"></span>
										<strong>Paladin</strong> Paladin generally uses a Shield/Mace/Sword/Flail. They are often tankers because of their increases to defense. They also have a higher magic defense then other fighting type tanks of the same rank.
									</li>
									<li class="style2">
										<span class="icon fa-folder-open"></span>
										<strong>Barbarian</strong> Barbarians are often used as DPS and on occasion tanks. They generally use Two-Handed/Axe/Hammer/Sword. They tend to have high health and strength compared to other fighters of the same rank. They have relatively low physical defense and poor magic defense.
									</li>
									<li class="style3">
										<span class="icon solid fa-signal"></span>
										<strong>Dragoon</strong> Dragoons often use a Spear or a lance. They often excel at speed compared to other fighters of the same rank, they have quite rounded stats otherwise.
									</li>
									<li class="style4">
										<span class="icon solid fa-laptop"></span>
										<strong>Knight</strong> Knights can be seen used many kinds of weapons and more often then other fighters are mounted. They have well rounded stats but excel in mounted combat.
									</li>
									<li class="style5">
										<span class="icon fa-gem"></span>
										<strong><font color="white">Battlemage</font></strong> Fighters who chose the job of a battlemage often use a scimitar and magic. The type of magic is limited compared to a natural mage but is more then other fighting classes. Usually keeping one hand free for magic they can enchant weapons & armor, create a small Shield or produce light.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="content">These are just a few of the jobs available. Jobs do not change your class they just give the fighter class an advantage in the job they have chosen, this does not limit them from using other weapons.</p>

									<h2>Roles</h2>
								</header>
									<p>Fighters often make up the front line roles in a party, they usually act as either tanks or dps. Although fighters get support skills it is rare to see a fighter dedicated to just support. Below are a few build examples:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Range dps build, Fighters can always pick up a bow or more likely a crossbow and use it, although it is more common for a knight. Job:Knight/Archer - Adv:Sipahis. This build gets benefits from being mounted and archery, it`s fast speed gives it a hard hit and ease to move about the battle field.</li>
										<li>Tank, <font color="green">Corpseater</font>, not the "ideal" tank but an interesting idea. This combination allows you to eat an enemy once they are dead causing you to self heal with the remains.</li>
										<li>Melee dps, skirmisher/dragoon. This one is an interesting combination and to call it "melee" is questionable depending on the skills picked. Using the dragoon "battlejump" to get into melee range, unleach dragoon melee skills and use the skirmisher`s "skirmish" skill to get away, before following up with a "spear charge" to get back in. With the long cool down`s on those skills though this build is a gimmik at best.</li>
										<li>Adv: inquisitor. This one is a personal favorite with a large two-handed battle hammer and the ability to enchant lands some high dps. Once you advance to inquisitor and are able to see your opponents weakness, needless to say it is a deadly combination.</li>
										<li>Support, battlemage/priest, using the buffing and debuffing skills from the range distance while keeping the ranged users covered with their role as a fighter.</li>
									</ul>
