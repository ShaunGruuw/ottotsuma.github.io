            <h2>Intro</h2>

          <p>Everyone will be familar with leveling to some degree but just to cover the basics. As a player progresses though the game, they will aquire experience and eventually level up. This can be done in many ways, such as: defeating opponents, completing quests, rewards from reaching achivements and many others.</p>
<!--<h3>Stat & skill points</h3>-->
          <p>When a player levels up a few things happen. Firstly your hp and mp increase, your hp is given by the formula (level*10 + vit*14.5) and mp by the formula (level*5 + mag*8). Next you aquire skill points and stat points. Skill points can be spent on upgrading your skills from rank 0 to 10, you gain one skill point per level, this is true for all normal classes but a few unique and quest classes are their own rules. Stat points are used to increase your base stats.</p>

        <h2>0 - 50</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Level 1 - 10, Starting at level 1 depending on the players choice of class a few different things will happen.</p>

      <p><a href="https://ottotsuma.github.io/mage.html">Mages</a>, will chose a basic mana-spell that they will train in until they unlock more basic mana-spells. After reaching level 10, they will unlock their first element which the can combine to their spells.</p>

      <p><a href="https://ottotsuma.github.io/fighter.html">Fighters</a>, will chose a basic fighting skill that they will train in until they unlock more basic fighting skills. After reaching level 10, they will unlock their first job which will inpact their skills.</p>

      <p><a href="https://ottotsuma.github.io/rouge.html">Rouges</a>, will chose a basic rouge skill that they will train in until they unlock more basic rouge skills. After reaching level 10, they will unlock the ability to store one spirit from a kill which will inpact their skills.
      </p>

      <p>Level 11 - 30, from level 11 onwards each class will be upgrading and gaining new skills to add to their roster. which each advancment they should be able to pratice and form a way of fighting unique to their race, class and desired play style. Once they reach level 30 the skill cap will raise from level 0 to level 3, this will allow them to upgrade their skills directly though skill points. These upgrades increase one core component of the skill.</p>

      <p>Level 31 - 50, from level 31 the players will be able to round out their play styles and increase their skill level with what they have gained. at level 30 they will be able to acess more pvp options are the area along side being able to venture further in the known world. Once a player reaches level 50 they are half way to completing their advanced class, as such they unlock a new part of their current class.</p>

      <p>Mages gain a secound element, this can be combined with the already known basic spells but also with the first element give new effects to each spell. One example would be if you took the fire element to start and now gained the wind you could create a fire tornado where as before you could not.</p>

      <p>Fighters can now chose to pick up a 2nd job role, where they might of taken a smiple job in the past to master one type of weapon they can now add to their arsenal by picking up another. Some might start out with a melee weapon and want to pick up knights training to be better able to use a large range of weapons including ranged ones. Others might decide to take up the role of a paladin gaining access to faith spells and taking on the role of defender.</p>

      <p>Rouges ability to eat and absorb the spirit or a kill increases, while this at first sounds like a small upgrade it is just as important as the other classes. This gives the rouge the ability to taken in more powerful spirits, this means they can absorb the spirit of more power opponents or a more powerful spirit of the same opponents as before. Where it was impossible to absorb the spirit of Banshees they would now be able to. Likewise with normal spirits like the Wolf would have access to more abilities and skills then before.</p>

    <section id="second">
      <header class="major">
        <h2>50 - 100</h2>
      </header>
      <p>level 50 - 70, once players reach level 50 and beyond they gain access to many monster raids, tracking & hunting mini quests and are more able to take on the larger scale pvp events, not because of any level increase but because of the team work pratice that allows for the transferable skills into the team style pvp. During these levels players now have access to a fuller roster of skills and abilities and are finding their roles trying out new posisions within larger scale parties. </p>

      <!--You often seen solo play or 4 team mebers at low levels but as the content gets harder the players form groups of 16-32 man raids-->

      <p>Level 70 Summons, these "summons" taken on a varity of names and nature depending on your class, a mage might call a summon a familia, while a fighter my companion and a rouge a projection. These are all true of their own classes and speak of the different ways each class makes contact and calls upon their summon. A mage reaches across the astral plane and forms a link with a creature though mana. Fighters will form bonds with creatures who later bind themselfes as companions. Rouges can project their animal spirit, the form which the spirit takes is their own spirits reflection not of what spirits they have absorbed.</p>

      <p>Summoned creatures can give active and passive benifits to the player, usually active benifits refer to skills or direct help in combat, these kind of summons are the most common, as players get a direct boost to their overall combat ability. Passive abilities can be found in some summons but thoes with no combat or weaker combat roles can be found to have more supportive passive abilities and skills. A dire wolf will be strong in combat comared to a wolf, but the wolf will be able to grant skills like "pact tatics" where the dire wolf cannot.</p>

      <p>Level 71-79, now that the players have access to personal summons they are often found getting use to fighting along side their new friends. With new abilities both passive and active and having to manage a summon. After level 71 however players now gain acess to the tomb raids this often helps them understand and use their summons outof combat abilities as well as their own.</p>

      <p>Level 80 skills, at this point players gain acess to intermediate skills and the level cap on skills raises from 3 to 6. This is similar to the level 30 upgrade but just to a higher degree.</p>

      <p>Level 81 - 99, players at these levels can be found praticing and improving their new skills as well as the skills they have upgraded and honed in previous levels.</p>

      <p>Level 100, at last? At this level players will finally be able to combine all the parts they have honed in previous levels to unlock and create advanced classes. These advanced classes are based on the previously made choices when leveling up such as elements, skills and spirits. It also takes into account the players play style choices from the highest level skilled to reccomend advanced classes that match the players choices. At this level the advanced skills are unlocked as the level cap for skills is increased from 6 to 9. There is much to do in post game in just this aspect alone but there are more quests and adventures to go on and more of the world to explore.
      <br><br>
      Finally, players may also chose at any time while level 100 to reset their class and choices made and return to level 1. Doing so will start a "NewGame+" (kind of). While this option is rarely taken as it offers no tangable benifits to the player on its own, when combined with the unlocking of a new element, class, or other aspect that was previously unavalible a player might chose to reset to make use of it.
      <br><br>
      As an example, if a player reaches level 100 and has a "normal" ranked class but descoverd a "rare" or even "epic" class they might chose to reset and play as the new class. Such as a player who has progressed though a religious quest line and unlocked the Inquisitor class, if they wish to play as this class they must reset and then they will be able to take on the Inquisitor class quests.</p>

    <section id="third">
      <header class="major">
        <h2>Advanced Class</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Such as your starting class, Class specific advancement(Magic element, Spirit, Job). As well as some of the less obvious choices towards class such as: your race, quest choices and avlibility of mentors.</p>

      <p>There are a few abilities and resorces that can be obtained before reaching advanced class but I would just like to menction them here as they will become more common at this level.</p>

      <p>Faith, Some people will never of encountered faith before. Some classes have access to faith spells. They work in a similar way to normal spells/skills, however they do not need mana but they are limited by how much faith one has. Faith is replenished at temples and by praying, and limit useage of them. e.g. a mage may spam fire ball as long as they have the mana, but a paladin may not spam holy shield as he will be limited to something like 3 uses, before needing to pray to recover (1/3) or return to the temple to recover (3/3).</p>

      <p>Command vs Charm, you may at any level put points into the Charisma stat. Doing so will make you more charming to NPC`s, with this increased charm it will be easier to build trust with an NPC and convince them to join you for a short period, provided that their level is not greater then your current Charisma stat. Command is slightly different, if you have a class with acess to command points, while these points are affected by your Charisma stat you are not convincing and NPC to join you but to serve you. The difference being that the NPC will stay with you for a long period of time, cannot be under level 10 and will be affected by your command skills.</p>

      <p>Exchange, in very rare cases some classes/races will have abilities (active or passive) to exchange their resources. Healers use mana to recover hp as some mages might use hp to recover their mana. There are some rare cases where a players mana or stamnina act as their hp in exchange for their entire hp. Such as a creature made of mana will add it`s Vitality to it`s mana instead of hp, but once it`s mana reaches 0 the creature is consired to have 0 hp.</p>
