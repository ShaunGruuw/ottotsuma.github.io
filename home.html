								<h2>Getting started</h2>
								<p>You starting race will always be human, you can change your race as you progress though the game in a varity of ways, the most common is to raise affinity with that race.<br><br>Everyone starts at level 1 with 100hp. As you level up you can unlock new skills/spells. You can invest in what stats are most important to you.<br><br>When you first start you might be confused about where you are, some of the players have uploaded their own user made maps (link below) so that if you are in the same place you can use it.</p>

								<h2>Starting Classes</h2>
								<p>To start with all players start in the same location, at the centre of the sphere grid. From the starting posistion players pick a path to take belonging to either the Rouge, Fighter or the Mage. Down each path are more branching paths where the stat increases match the skills and this way the players can pick their own style. It is possible to go down more then one path but it is reccomended only after level 100 as before it could be considerd to be spreading yourself too thin. (I cannot wait to see execptions to this guideline however.) Some classes are unlocked though the users choices including racial choice and are not apart of the main 3 choices, such as turning into a vampire unlocks the vampire path.</p>

								<p>Once a player has placed points into a either skill or attribute node, the points cannot be undone easily. The few times points can be removed is when a race is changed and the spent points are not longer applicable with the new race. It is already quite rare to change a race but to render points unsuable is even more rare. The 2nd and more common way is when a player picks an advanced class that is not compatable with skills from another class. There are not many instances of this but an example is a priest with points in curse magic.</p>
