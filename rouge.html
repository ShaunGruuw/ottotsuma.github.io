								<h2>Rouge Overview</h2>
								<p>Rouges are a class that allow the user to absorb the spirit of their kills into themselves and use this to improve. This is often why Rouges make good hunters, scouts, assassins, investigators, gardeners, and so much more. They use their animal (or what ever else the absorbed) adaptations to their advantage.</p>
								<h3>Poison</h3>
								<p>Affects like poison, fire, fear can be resisted or your target might even have immunity to such an affect. This immunity refers to normal type poisons, rouges and other classes that specialises in such affects will always have skills/abilities or otherways to circumnavigate such resistances.</p>

									<h2>Spirits</h2>
									 </header>
									<p>Spirits are not ghosts, they are not even powerful by themselves. Spirits give access to skills/powers/abilities & spells, this is why rouges choose to let spirits in.</p>

									<p>A spirit can be obtained by eating the heart of the prey. While not always successful, it can grant the rouge access to that prey`s abilities. Eg. An eagle`s spirit can grant access to the "eagle eyes" skill and other stat boosts. Below are some of a few spirit examples:</p>

								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">
										<span class="icon solid fa-code-branch"></span>
										<strong>Smilodon</strong>Similar to a saber-toothed tiger, Grants: enhanced Stealth and enhanced Strength.
									</li>
									<li class="style2">
										<span class="icon fa-folder-open"></span>
										<strong>Dobhar-ch√∫</strong> More commonly known as "King Otter", Grants: enchanted defence and skill "final whistle".
									</li>
									<li class="style3">
										<span class="icon solid fa-signal"></span>
										<strong>Glaistig</strong> A Glaistig is a ghost with a weakness to water, Grants: affinity increase with cattle, and the skill "vengeance".
									</li>
									<li class="style4">
										<span class="icon solid fa-laptop"></span>
										<strong>Baobhan sith</strong> Baobhan is a female vampire found deep within the forests, Grants: enhanced stealth and the skill "ability drain".
									</li>
									<li class="style5">
										<span class="icon fa-gem"></span>
										<strong><font color="white">Panotti</font></strong> Panotti are a humanoid race with large ears, Grants: enhanced hearing and cold resistance.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="content">These are just a few of the spirits available. Spirits do not change your class they just give the rouge class a unique and playstyle and a way to access more skills</p>

									<h2>Roles</h2>
								</header>
									<p>Rouges often make up the physical damage roles in a party, they usually act as dps both ranged and melee. Rouges often get support skills for an adventuring party and are often seen in this role as well. Below are a few build examples:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Range dps build, Spirit: Grat (seed spitter), With a crossbow/bow any ranged weapons, the Grat bonuses help towards ranged accuracy and speed. It`s special skill to spit seeds from your mouth also count as a physical ranged attack. While not a commonly picked spirit, the advantage is that you always have a ranged weapon even while unarmed, So those ranged bonuses don`t go to waste.</li>
										<li>Tank, Spirit:<font color="green">Adamantoise</font>, The adamantoise spirit grants defence enchantments (in exchanged for speed) and the skill "tough as a turtle" manifesting a giant turtle shell infront of the user to absorb damage. You do not often see a rouge tank, but when you do it is an agility tank aiming to provoke but not be hit, this spirit add`s to your survive-ability, while not a common spirit to acquire in the early stages of the game it would allow you to stand toe to toe with more traditional tanks.</li>
										<li>Poison dps, Spirit: Kelzmelzer (insectoid species), With it`s poison focus this suits a rouge who specialises in poisons. It`s skill "liquid poison" allows your to coat your weapon or fill a vial with poison to be used anytime. While other spirits have similar uses Kelzmlizer spirits are not hard to come by.</li>
										<li>Melee dps, Spirit: Fachan, while granting enchanged physical damage (to one hand) it lowers accuracy. This works well with one-handed weapons as it only increases the damage on one hand. The idea is that the damage output makes up for the lower accuracy, a rouge often has higher accuracy then other classes to begin with, so this can be a less risky choice then appears on the face of it.</li>
										<li>Support, Spirit: Mite, a small beetle. This magical beetle grants the skill "see though mein eyes" which allows the user to see what the target is seeing. While there are many support skills with a more direct impact I feel this has more everyday use for a party, despite the limitations of the skill in regards to who can be targeted.</li>
