	(basic classes are the options given when you start, does not have to always be normal type class. Advanced classes are just classes beyound the basic classes, can also be normal type.)

Items follow a smililar logic

Races follow no such pattern. Each as benifits and disadvantages of it`s own. 

Spells/Skills are on a spheregrid alongside attribute nodes (stat change nodes). They are often blocked (greyed out) until a certen level or criteria is met. Once unlocked a player can dump level points into the node until full. So at level 30 Spells/Skills beyond the basic`s are unlocked up to a cap of 3, So a player can only put a maximum of 3 points into a spell (unless otherwise stated). This happens again at level 80 the cap is raised to 6 and players can now improve the potency/cast time/range/area/etc. Of each of their unlocked skills.

									<h2>Spirits</h2>
									 </header>
									<p>Spirits are not ghosts, they are not even powerful by themselves. Spirits give access to skills/powers/abilities & spells, this is why rouges choose to let spirits in.</p>

									<p>A spirit can be obtained by eating the heart of the prey. While not always sucessful, it can grant the rouge access to that prey`s abilities. Eg. An egeal`s spirit can grant access to the "egeal eyes" skill and other stat boosts. Below are some of a few spirit examples:</p>
								
								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">
										<span class="icon solid fa-code-branch"></span>
										<strong>Smilodon</strong>Similar to a saber-toothed tiger, Grants: enhanced Stealth and enhanced Strength.
									</li>
									<li class="style2">
										<span class="icon fa-folder-open"></span>
										<strong>Dobhar-ch√∫</strong> More commonly known as "King Otter", Grants: enchaned defence and skill "final whistle".
									</li>
									<li class="style3">
										<span class="icon solid fa-signal"></span>
										<strong>Glaistig</strong> A Glaistig is a ghost with a weakness to water, Grants: afinity increase with cattle, and the skill "vengence".
									</li>
									<li class="style4">
										<span class="icon solid fa-laptop"></span>
										<strong>Baobhan sith</strong> Baobhan is a female vampire found deep within the forests, Grants: enchanced stleath and the skill "ability drain".
									</li>
									<li class="style5">
										<span class="icon fa-gem"></span>
										<strong><font color="white">Panotti</font></strong> Panotti are a humonid race with large ears, Grants: enchanced hearing and cold resistance.

									<h2>Roles</h2>
								</header>
									<p>Rouges often make up the physical dammage roles in a party, they usually act as dps both ranged and melee. Rouges often get support skills for an adventureing party and are often seen in this role aswell. Below are a few build examples:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Range dps build, Spirit: Grat (seed spiter), With a crossbow/bow any ranged wepons, the Grat bonuses help towards ranged accuracy and speed. It`s special skill to spit seeds from your mouth also count as a physical ranged attack. While not a commonly picked spirit, the advantage is that you always have a ranged wepon even while unarmed, So thoes ranged bonuses don`t go to waste.</li>
										<li>Tank, Spirit:<font color="green">Adamantoise</font>, The adamantoise spirit grants defence enchantments (in exchanged for speed) and the skill "tough as a turtle" manifiesting a giant turtle shell infrount of the user to absorb dammage. You do not often see a rouge tank, but when you do it is an agility tank aiming to provoke but not be hit, this spirit add`s to your survive-abilty, while not a common spirit to aquire in the early stages of the game it would allow you to stand toe to toe with more triditonal tanks.</li>
										<li>Poison dps, Spirit: Kelzmelzer (insectoid species), With it`s poison focus this suits a rouge who specalises in poisons. It`s skill "liquid poison" allows your to coat your wepon or fill a vial with poison to be used anytime. While other spirits have similar uses Kelzmlizer spirits are not hard to come by.</li>
										<li>Melee dps, Spirit: Fachan, while granting enchanged physical damage (to one hand) it lowers accuracy. This works well with one-handed weapons as it only increases the dammage on one hand. The idea is that the dammage output makes up for the lower accuracy, a rouge often has higher accurcy then other classes to begin with, so this can be a less risky choice then appears on the face of it.</li>
										<li>Support, Spirit: Mite, a small beatle. This magical beatle grants the skill "see though mein eyes" which allows the user to see what the target is seeing. While there are many support skills with a more direct impact I feel this has more everyday use for a party, dispite the limitations of the skill in reguards to who can be targeted.</li>
