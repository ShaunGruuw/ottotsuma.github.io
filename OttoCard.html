    If this is all redone for level 100 cap this works well. 10 levels new unlock skill cap till 10. 11 with item like Z-move
    stat points cap out at 100 because of level cap, 400 @ level 100. 
    skill points (unknown) but i guess less skills is good? less hot bars, but 10 skills seems too few...including passives also...
        
    
    
    Classes, normal (blue), rare (green), epic (red), Unique (purple), legendary (Orange), growth-type (Seraph(pink)), Quest/inherent (gold). 

(basic classes are the options given when you start, does not have to always be normal type class. Advanced classes are just classes beyound the basic classes, can also be normal type.)

Items follow a smililar logic

Races follow no such pattern. Each as benifits and disadvantages of it`s own. 

Spells/Skills are on a spheregrid alongside attribute nodes (stat change nodes). They are often blocked (greyed out) until a certen level or criteria is met. Once unlocked a player can dump level points into the node until full. So at level 30 Spells/Skills beyond the basic`s are unlocked up to a cap of 3, So a player can only put a maximum of 3 points into a spell (unless otherwise stated). This happens again at level 80 the cap is raised to 6 and players can now improve the potency/cast time/range/area/etc. Of each of their unlocked skills. 

Strength - +1  		Physical Damage
Vitality - +2		HP 
Defence - +0 		Physical Damage reduction
Magic - +0			Magical Damage
MDef - +0			Magical damage reduction
Dexterity - +0		Attack Speed 

Sense - +0			Trap Detect
Charisma - +0		Dialog Pass

Level 0 - 50
0 - Starting skills unlocked, 10 - Gain spirit eating ability, 30 - basic skills unlocked(cap raised from 0 to 3), 50 - Advance spirit (Plus increase chance in spirit eating sucess).

Level 51 - 100
70 - Unlock Spirit Projection (different from summoned creatures), 80 - intermidate skills unlocked (cap raised from 3 to 6), 100 - Class advancement

Class advancement
As with other classes your advance class choices will depend on your starting class (Rouge), Spirit absorbed (At time of advance). If you pick a unique/quest class you cannot also pick an advanced class. (eg. You cannot be Saint and Vishkanya at the same time.)

110 - 7
180 - 8
200 - 9
240 - 10
300 - 11 (some skills, super teir)
500 - 
999 - 
MAX - 

hp
100 + (level * 10) + (vit *14.5) {basic, change on class?}
2100 + 1320 = 3420

Mp
(level * 5) + (mag * 8)
1000 + 3920 = 4920


Bubble - 90% of used MP.
90% of 4000 is 3600
90% of 8000 is 7200

With 200 vit at 200, you get 5000hp 
With blue Items you can get over 10,000hp at level 200.
Class skills for tanks and stuff would really go past it.

Physical bubble - reduces physcial damage taken (X% dammage reduced, Y% mana taken)
https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Barrier_(ability) Nope Just use stone skin.

level ?, 100 damage, 5 reduced, 95 done. 5% reduction. 
mana reduced 3. 50% of the damage taken as mana
500 damage, 25 reduced, 425 done. 5% reduction. 
mana reduced 13. 50% of the damage taken as mana

1, 10, prime. 
1 = 9%
10 = 90% 
Prime = 19% 

Wep speeds are speeds given {this looks good}
Dammage =  (Power * (Str/Def) * Rand) * RoundUp
rand =(RANDBETWEEN(240,271)/100)
RoundUp - (ROUNDUP(dex,-1)/10) - where its rounding dex to the 10`s
no need for wep damage it is inlcuded in the enchantments, the rarer the wepon the higher the encantments can be on it eg iron > steel 
Magic formula the same

Kyber Sword, normal
(490 mag + (2*level) + 1) * RAND - (def*Rand) = 1582
say mdef is 100. rand is 2.
Duel Stats, mdef and rand same. 
Dammage 2062 
Estmate that people with 100 mdef & 3000 hp at level 200 would not be too rare.

Magic power = Cast speed ish 
cast speed 0 ~ 5
Wep Power 0 ~ 100
Skill 0 ~ 500 ~ half level
Wep speed 0 ~ 5

Attack speed base (ASB) = 3, newspeed (NS) = ASB * e^-(3/dex)???
move speed = base move speed + bonuses + (dex / x)

Speed
roundup(dex,-1)/10
=(F4*(ROUNDUP(E3,-1)/10))
F4 = damage
E3 = dex

Remeber spells take time to cast mostly, skills are mostly instant and we are focusing on a normal attack it might take 2 secs to swing an axe or chant a spell

<p>Just FWI, First play I found mostly blue and a few green items, I am still using the necklace and dagger. Secound play I got the faerie ring from the count quest line (it gives a random epic item). The third playthough I got the protect ring during the southern war questline as a random drop. My orange items I got after level 200. I know most people are rocking blue/green with one red item.</p>

<p>This is leaving out all the hidden bonuses that the items give, and I think most players will be supprised at the bonuses blue/green items give. And the true reason why legendary stats seem so high.</p>

<h4>Guild Bonuses</h4>
<p>
Guild Or Kingdom bonuses don`t have a huge affect on base stats.
</p>

<h4>Title Bonuses</h4>
<p>
Titles have a direct affect on base stats, usually this is all titles do it is rare to find a title that dosen`t increase your stats. Such as Knight Slayer, +10 vitality +3 strength. (Everything displayed on this page is not including title affects.)
</p>

<h4>Other stats</h4>
<p>HP is 1710 with all items on, this includes my -50% hp</p>
<p>MP is 7380 with all items on, this includes my +50% mp</p>
<p>Resist normal weapons total is 15% from vamp, 9% from skills, 24% total</p>
<p>Resist magic is 19% from skills</p>
<p>Dueling I have a 49% increase in stats</p>
<p>Increased sword attack is 9% + 15% = 24%</p>

<div id="CardContainer">

<h2>0 - 50</h2>
<p>Leveling: Since starting out I have been reset back to level 1 a few times, when you first start you can procced with a quest line, there should be enough quest lines that when you reset you can pick another although some of them are quite short. Honestly the resetting process gives you a good excuse to go though other quests and the reward instead of becoming obsolte helps at the level it was intended for.</p>

<p>PVP: I do not do a lot of pvp espically early on, I know ranks 1, 30 and 50 pvp are quite popular death matches and other team style matches but in the early stages I enjoy doing the quests.</p>

<p>Class: To start with I became a <font color="blue">Mage</font> I started with Electric and wind. Later after becoming a <font color="green"> vampire</font> I changed my elements (First reset) to <font color="green"> blood</font> and wind. Later I found <font color="green"> bubble</font> element (secound reset) so I swapped to blood and bubble.</p>

<h2>50 - 100</h2>

<p>Leveling: In the mid section of leveling I joined in more monster raids, hunting and tracking type quests, I also really enjoyed the invasion and defence missions, as now you are at a level where you can really have an inpact.</p>

<p>PVP: At this level I find i join in the kingdom PVP events, such as the relic capture and throne, I also like the guild capture events but I still have little intrest in doing death matches and this level even the guild war matches but it is just personal prefrence.</p>

<!-- Third Race -->
<section id="third" class="main special">
<header class="major">

<h2>Advanced Class</h2>
</header>
<p>The first time I reached advanced class I became and <font color="blue">inquisitor</font>, it is a bit of a battle mage, part melee and short ranged spells. I found it was lacking a large AOE high dammage spell or more triditional mage type skills and instead was more a spell sword.</p>

<p>The secound time I became a <font color="blue">bloodmage</font>, Although the prerequisite is that you have the rare blood element the advance class is normal, guessing there are more ways to unlock this class. Very much a Glass cannon in pvp, the skills are slightly more for pve but quite a good balance. In pve I found it was a glass cannon but survived a little better as it excelled at dealing with small mobs but against a single large foe it became a glass cannon again.</p>

<p>My third advance is <font color="red">Tulak</font> this unlock did not come from my elements but from another source. Although I am excited to try an Epic class this is clearly a pvp focus class, and I believe it does not suit me.</p>

magic defence +10.<!--Increases magic regeneration + 10%,  magic resistance +5%, normal weapon resistance +3% and stealth.--> <br> This item is epic rated becasue of its rareity to find. It also increases encounter chance, hostility, and suspicion. I do often use it in place of the necklace (because of the other hidden affects) but it leaves me with obvious weaknesses to my class. (Mages are weak to silence and with low hp also poisons.)

</div></div>

<break>

<h2>After level 100</h2>
<p>
Leveling: I find that the -8% exp gain is more then it first appears as to get this class although I only had to reset twice it puts me far behind other players espically thoes who chose not to reset. At level 200 the leader is at level 317, I assume with a PVE spcific class.
<br><br>PVP: I join in pvp more now then I use to, as my class leads me in that direction. I find that since I am not very good at pvp the class bonuses help bridge that gap but do not shine as they should. 
<br><br>Extras: My stats at first glance appear like a slow, low but not detrimental hp and a high attack output. The zero in sense means my weakness to traps and rouge classes is clear. 
<br>
Due to the hidden stats with my equipment, race, class etc I find that my movement speed is slow, but my attack speed is not. This is somewhat offset with skills but only while I have mp. My hp recovery is what keeps me alive longer then you would think with my blood elemental magic, vampire skills & high hp recovery. I have a high mp drain on my build but also a high base recovery and some skills to help.
</p>  


<footer class="major">
<button class="collapsible">FAQ</button>
<div class="contentInner">
<p>
I have decided to add an FAQ because I often get asked the same things.
</p>
<p>
Is it possible to get 100% normal weapon resistance? Yes, but you will be insanely weak to almost everything else, everything comes at a hidden cost. (ps. No I do not know how to do it)
</p>
<p>
Where did you get "****"? All my Items/Class/Race etc. If I choose to share and help it will be displayed on this page, if I do not reveal something, I am not shareing it. 
</p>
<p>
Are Orange/Legend Items OP? This game is first of all about discovery which is why many of the stats of the items etc. I do not acctually know as they are hidden. The rating refers to how hard they are to find, I can assure you that the higher the stats or options of an item appears to be means there are really detrimental hidden affects paired with the item. To give an example, the <font color="gold"> cursed ring </font> from the counts quest line. Stats look amazing on the display, but as all thoes that have tried to put it on know the hidden affcts are horrific. 　
</p>
<p>
If they are so bad why do you use them? I never said they where bad, the <font color="gold"> cursed ring </font> is an extreme example but it is to say as long as you can work around or do not care for the downsides they are still really good items. Also this is in general, but the higher the rarity usually the better overall the item is, it really comes down to your personal prefrence.
</p>
<p>
How can I tell if my item has a hidden affect? Testing... Trial and error is the only way and alot of maths. To help you though take blue items for example. They can give a single stat boost from +0 to +40 to +80. +40 usually means it is a normal item no hidden affects. +20 for example is likely to have a positive hidden affect. +80 meanwhile will likely have a negative hidden affect. Additonally some hidden affects are shown if your detect item enchantment is high enough.  
</p>
<p>
Why do you still wear the <font color="blue"> Shinra Alpha</font>? The beta is really easy to get! Yes, while I own a beta the hidden affects while have little to zero affect on most builds, really hurt mine. <!--Reduced mp recovery 10%-->
</p>
<p>
Why the <font color="green">System Shock </font>? Truthfully I do not have any of the other shock series, I am desprate to swap this for any other.
</p>
<p>
Why did you pick a class that is not suited to what you enjoy? It is not like I do not enjoy the class, even if it is focused towards PVP. 
</p>
<p>
Kyber sword vs lazer sword. I get this one alot as the kyber sword is quite rare and lazer sword proforms a very similar purpose. The reduction on my class only works for the Kyber sword not the lazer sword, so that pushes me towards using it. I find the attack higher on a kyber sword but the mp drain is also higher, I am not sure what other hidden affects there are. With the 50% reduction my drain in mp works out as still more of a drain then a lazer sword.
</p>
<p>
What happens after level 100 or even 200? 100-200 is clear here that you unlock skills up to level 9 (not saying when). There are new parts of the world unlocked, pvp, events the usual, really it is about expoloring your options and the world, the quests etc you`re leveling up less often so the focus shifts alot. 200+ for me it`s speculation. All I know is somewhere from 200-300 you get level 10 skills. I am told that there is more of a focus on the non-combat stuff, not that the stuff before goes away what I mean is that the new parts are more often non-combat.

Ghosts - Phase shift - increases physical resistance alot, sometimes even 100% for a period of time, Ghosts also have high physical resistance normally. Such as Vanish which makes the user unable to attack but 100% physical resistance for a short period.

Fire attack on me, 19% magic resist, 50% elemental reduction, 50% Mbarrier 
lets say 14 power,  14*(300/260)*rand = 26 (low level spell vs level 200 with high mdef...)
26 - 19% - 50% = 8
@magic 400, 56 becomes 17 
@power 70 270 becoms 84

physical, with 11 str i do 20 dam. @400, 716 dam. (with -50% hp dead in 2.3 hits.)

Dammage = Power * (mag/mDef) * Rand 
rand =(RANDBETWEEN(240,271)/100)
Magic formula the same


Barrier - 1/2 Physical damage for a period of time 
M barrier - 1/2 magical dammage for a period of time 
- 16 mp to activate and drains mp of target 
(so you can cast it on an ally)

Mp costs - 
my mp
(level * 5) + (mag * 8)
1000 + 3920 = 4920

avg 100 ~ 1500 ~ 2000
100 * 5 = 500
100 * 8 = 800
total = 1300

Avg 200 ~ 3000 - 4000
1000 + (200*8) = 2600

5 mp ~ int @1
4 mp power = 0.5x @ 7
It costs 6 MP to cast, takes 25 AP to learn, and has a spell power of 14.  @ 9
4 mp 12 power @ 10
Fire costs 6 MP to cast, Dark Fire costs 8 MP, and Tri-Fire costs 68 MP. @ cc

@10 magic fomula is easier, 1 mp : 3 power
cc is more accurate to our game, unknown power 
9 is the most polished ... 1mp : 2.5 power 
@7 ties power to magic ...
