          <p>Charia Jun 12 21-12, GrandDuchy of Alden. Near the village of Steinauhau, 24km from the nearest neighbour village of Sweausern. A rebellion is being hosted in the neighbouring provence of Heilerbach. The GrandDuchy of Alden is home to 3.2 million people and about 58km. Making it the 2nd smallest state on the continent of Charia. Steinauhau is a small village with an urban population of 1700 people and rural population of 9300 people. It sits in a temperate forest near the sea, in the northern area of the continent.</p>
          
          <h2>0-14</h2>
          <h3>Steinauhau</h3>

            <!-- Starting with the setting up of the place? and events. -->
          <p>"Congratulations!" A unified cheer rang out around the town hall, looking down into his cup David lamented, the reflection looking back at him is far older then it use to be, stiff and past the age where he should be drinking luminescent green drinks, but he had always liked melon pop from his first taste over 70 years ago now. Soon the reflection in the cup smiles back. "You look happier then you have in years" his thoughts interrupted David turns to see his old friend Edmure. "I was just thinking about how new life replaces the old" he continues to smile. With a frown and then a small smile Edmure retorts "You thinking Michkels new babe is here to replace you?, there is still life left in the both of us yet". The small gathering carries on into the night. June 12th a night the people of Alden celebrate the new life brought into this world over the past year, a small tradition as not all make it past infancy.</p>

          <h3>Play day</h3>
            <!-- starting with the kids meeting as friends, introduce the town, some news the people, small parts of the world, culture-->
          <p>"Hey Karla" Michkel waves across the village square towards a tall woman holding hands with 3 children. Two older girls and a boy, all the children had red hair like their mother. As the two groups get closer Michkel nudges Sarah his wife and points to his son's smiling face, they smile to each other. "Good to see you are all well" Sarah say's towards Karla and bends down to smile at the children. "Where is Robert?" chimes Michkel. "He's going to meet us later on, went to the hall to get the news and left me alone with these loverly lot" Karla replies. The now larger group makes their way towards a near by wood, where they meet with other adults of the village and their children, the group of children run off into the forest to play as the adults make way for a fire, today is a festive day June 12th.</p>

          <!-- Children in the forest -->
         <p>The group of 7 laughing running into the forest, beyond the eyes of their parents, they arrive at a circular clear area within the small wooded area they often play. Eugen 13 years of age, larger, and taller then the others of the group, but without a temper or ambition he plays with children younger then him rather then the older children of the village. Beke, 12 a slow child, but easily angered. Ilse 12, the oldest child of Sarah and Robert. Effi 10 the younger sister of Ilse. Otto 10 the oldest son of Michkel and Karla, with two younger brothers, and a sister on the way. Nils 10 the 8th child of the village leader, although only 5 remain. Jakob 9, A small boy, shy and un-gifted.</p>

         <!-- <p>The children are armed with wood swords, shields, spears and staves. Today like most days they pretend to be heroes from old stories, facing off in small 1v1's with little organization or any teams at all. After settling their small disputes and deciding who gets to be which hero they turn to battle their foe as a team. Under the command of Ilse, who while not the oldest child was Eugen had to little ambition to even lead a group as small as this and Beke who's temper is too hot to make any meaningful decisions. They charge in and out fighting a tree with a 'monster' draw onto the side.</p> -->

         <!-- What about adding the children arguing instead of just saying they did? -->
        
        <p>"I want to be a fighter today!"</p>
        <p>"Do you even know what fighters do? I heard your parents where farmers"</p>
        <p>"Of course I know! We all went to lessons, they move the mana inside them to where it is needed to become faster or stronger" Otto replies happy with himself </p>
        <p> "You cant be a fighter, you don't have a sword, bow or anything at all! you have to be a mage, unless you want to be a rouge.." Beke snickers.</p>
        <p> Otto picks up a stick and swings it about like a sword</p>
        <p>"Ahahaha" Beke burst into laughter</p>
        <p>"It's a wand. I was just testing it."</p>
        <p>"You two stop arguing and get into position the monster is here!" Ilse points to a tree with a monster draw onto it's side..</p>
        <p>
        That is how the team ended up with 4 melee fighters, 2 ranged fighters and 1 mage</p>
         
         <p>"Charge!" <br> "Heavy blow!" <br>  "Battle shout!" <br> "Provoke" </p>
         <p>The sounds of the fight ring out though the small clearing. "Hig-h Impact!!", "Fire Ball!". "fire ball? That's not a junior skill thats intermediate. We all agreed to start at junior level." Berk grows towards the smaller Otto. "I thought we must of leveled up by now!" retorts Otto. "Why would we level up it's not even dead yet!" Berk shouts back. "come on now, we can't get distracted in a fight! Otto must of just got tired of being the mage every time" Ilse steps in to redirect Berks attention. "He's the mage because he cannot afford a real weapon, that is not even a wand it's just a stick" Beke spits out. Otto looks down at the stick in his hand, true enough it was no real wand. "that's what wands are, just sticks, now kill that monster!" Isle points towards the tree and Beke runs up and slams his shield into the tree and stabs it with his sword point before triumphantly shouting that he had slain the monster.</p>
         <!-- The play introduces the reader in to what happens in the world, and monsters -->

          <!-- play comes to an end, the festivities start -->
          <p>As the sun reaches the middle of the sky the group run back from the forest at the smell of food, they soon catch the lights of the large fire and the food being passed around the smaller children and the adults. They pick up the pace and run over to join in the festivities.</p>

          <!-- They continue their days with the adults working, the children play or help out -->
          <!-- news could be brought back from the town hall by Robert -->
            <p>Charia Jun 12 21-22, The GrandDuchy shares a large boarder with the Principality of Huonhia to the south-east, a small boarder with the Principality of Leikia to the South. A mostly abandoned boarder with the Kingdom of Hatalisa to the west. The kingdom has recently made peace with the Pocotocotcan Theocracy, after joining forces with Leikia, Chalbia & the Mifuegan League off far to the west, the peace led Pocotocotcan to give lands to the Empire, including the trading town of Tlapatan.</p> 
                     
            <p> To the North they share another large boarder with the Heilerbach Republic, along this boarder on the Republics side has growing unrest. Due to their neighbors attention being focused west, or internally the GrandDuchy has had relative pace throughout the past decade.</p>
            <!-- around the year 21-22 the rebellion breaks out -->

            <h3>Incident</h3>
          <!-- the incident -- re-do, the reader leaves knowing the world is not easy, the game style world they live in, charter skeletons they take with them. -->
          <p>The group are playing deep inside the forest when one of them discovers lurking near by is a leaf green figure, with a large yellow eye, webbed hands and feet with black sharp nails attached, a small belly and a slight hunchback. Its mouth shaped like bird beak but with small teeth protruding up from below. One of them shouts "monster detected!" and all the children scramble towards the creature in a charge. Unaware of the dangers of reality.</p>

          <p>Ilse shouts commands at the others to form up, and attack, ordering Otto to cast a protection spell on the Eugen, Effi to stand and protect her as she gives commands, Jakob and Nils to use their bows and for Beke Eugen to run forth and provoke the creature.</p>

          <p>At first the young Kappa is surprised and taken back by the sudden attacks and loud shouting, the children are spurred on by their advantage and Beke slams his shield into the creature and stabs at its ribs with his wooden sword shouting "shield bash" with great joy. Eugen follows up by stabbing into the creature with his spear, the tip is dull but with enough force to pierce though the creatures skin, a long high screech sounds out in the clearing, confident Eugen tries to thrust further in but is unable. A toy arrow lands at Jakob's feet, Nils off into the distance. A child's cry fills the air, Eugen balled over on the ground holding his face as blood drips from it, in the struggle to pull his spear back the young kappa had slashed across his face in its panic.</p>

          <p>Ilse dashes froward to help, as Beke in his panic and anger curses Otto, "You where told to cast protection why didn't you cast protection!" Otto knowing this is no longer part of any game desperately wishes he could of done anything at all to help, drops his wand. The young kappa no sooner had slashed the boys face freed himself of the spear jumps on his back and stabs his webbed claws into his his neck. Blood squeezes out of the holes and around his sharp claws, Ilse runs up to the pair and tries to pull the creature off. Beke standing before his friend screaming in pain, starts hitting the creature with his sword and stabbing at his eyes, soon the creature lets out a screech as he jumps off Eugen, who is now silent on the ground in a pool of his own blood.</p>

          <p>Effi who was suppose to be protecting her older sister had been stood still in the shock of it all, suddenly sprung to life and jumped into the frey, the 3 children, Ilse, Beke & Effi beat on the monster with their swords defending with shields. The monster now hidden from view of Otto muttering magic spells he heard of from stories and Jakob collecting a few rocks from the ground, while Nils throws them at the monster where he can.</p>

          <p>In the short frenzy the creature knocks Effi aside, and makes a break for it running towards the tree line, the children give chase, Jakob bending down to pick a rock is slammed into by a fleeing monster who rips at Jakob's face and sides pulling out chunks of flesh and blood from the screaming child. The others more panicked scream and run towards the monster and Jakob Beke first, larger and stronger then the others who pushes the monster off Jakob only to receive quick swipes towards his shield, Ilse dives in and plunges her sword into the creatures left eye, it oozes out black liquid as the creature lets out a loud scream and plunges his claws into Ilse's stomach.</p>

          <p>Effi arriving later then her stronger faster comrades pushes her shield between Ilse and the creature who with his weight alone pushes them to the ground, Effi holds the shield between them trying to protect her older sister as the creature strikes down a blinding flash of light appears near the creatures one good eye and blinds it. "Heavy strike" Beke shouts as he slams his sword over the creatures head, as the creature spins and swipes its claws randomly Effi shouts "Provoke" and feels the creature attention directly on her, despite it being unable to see. It charges, as the creature arrives onto Effi's shield again, Ilse plunges her little toy sword into the creature's wound and its heart stops from the impact, the creature falls to the ground breathing heavily as Beke smashes his sword over its head again. It die's from blood loss shortly after.</p>

          <p>The whole encounter took just a few moments, even though to the group it felt a long time. Two of their friends lay dead in their own blood, Nils kneels by Jakob's body shivering unable to bring himself to move or speak. Beke shouts out for all to hear, blaming all of the others, until his eyes land on Eugen only then does he break, seeing his friends mangled and shredded face. Effi holds her older sister in her arms, repeating over and over that mother will be here soon, it will be okay. Ilse dies looking back at Effi unable to speak, lungs full of blood.</p>

          <p>"Level up!" the words cover Otto's vision.</p>

          <p>Soon the adults who had long heard the unusual screams come running into the clearing, shocked at the scene before them, quickly checking to the children and the monsters body.</p>

          <p>"You know what kind of creature this is?" Edmure asks. "Yeah, a Kappa, a young one at that, less then 2 years old." replies David. Edmure looks towards him and David continues. "Not native to here of course I've never seen one this far south, or this far from a river, they rarely leave the waters only to snatch prey or children who wonder off alone. But never this far and never before they reach adulthood."</p>
          <p>The duo stand watching the body burn. "Scouting turned up nothing, maybe it really did get driven south by the events in the north, there were no traces of other kappas in the area. That being said I have had reports of increasing monster attacks from Swexausern."</p>
          <div class="pop">Young-Kappa<img class="popOut" src="./images/Kappa.png" alt="Kappa"></div>
          <!-- Lurking in the water is a strange child-sized humanoid that resembles a bizarre cross between a turtle, a lizard, and a monkey. It has a beak-like mouth, scaly reptilian skin, clawed and webbed hands, and a turtle-like shell on its back. In the top of its head is a bowl-like depression filled with water. -->

          <h3>Aftermath</h3>
          <!-- punishment -->

          <h4>Otto POV</h4>
          <!-- a reflection for some of the others maybe about the deaths? monsters? -->
          <p>Sitting alone in his room later that night he could not help but reflect back on what was told to him earlier. The numbers displayed in front of him right now where his stats, he could even see his class, the spells he could learn in the future and last of all his level, 1.</p>

          <p class="stats">
            <li>Name: Otto.</li>
            <li>Level: 1.</li>
            <li>Primary Class: Mage.</li>
            <li>Spells: 1.</li>
            <li>Titles: 0.</li>
            <li>Spell points: 0.</li>
            <li>Stat points: 2.</li>
            <li>Stats:</li>
            <li>Strength: 0</li>
            <li>Vitality: 0</li>
            <li>Endurance: 0</li>
            <li>Magic: 0</li>
            <li>MDef: 0</li>
            <li>Dexterity: 0</li>
            <li>Sense: 1</li>
            <li>Charisma: 2</li>
          </p>

          <p>He was told not to spend any of the points or learn any spells yet, that he was going to be sent to the village hall tomorrow to be tested for his aptitude and when he was 14 he would go to the magic academy in Banderdam.</p>

          <p>Almost all the stats where 0 however, this could not be good. Thinking at first there was a mistake he asked his parents but he soon learned that these numbers are a display of how much the mana can affect him and his spells, them being 0 just means that his mana flow to these areas is poor. The mana would not contribute toward anything he tried to do.</p>

          <p>All children growing up are told stories of heros and villains, magic, monsters, and great warriors. But nothing was ever said about how to unlock their class, skills, or stats. Almost like everyone who had unlocked them was sworn to silence, today he found out that was true. For their own protection as the only way to unlock stats was to slay a monster in battle without the help of anyone with stats, knowing this some children might carelessly try and fight a monster before they where 14. Naturally not everyone kept the secret and most children had killed a monster before they where 14 just usually just one their parent had picked out for them, something less dangerous.</p>

          <h4>Beke POV</h4>
          <p>Beke outside the village hall, looking around he could see some of the children he use to play with, the older children of the area. They pay little or no attention to Beke as he comes into the hall they instead are deep into their studies or practice.</p>

          <p>He makes his way past the children on the right practicing with swords, spears & shields. To the left children practice copying the movements of different animals, boars, snakes, dogs, cats even rats. A look of rejection comes across Beke's face to these children doing odd movements. He arrives are the large wooden doors to the hall, *describe the hall* He makes his way inside, seeing children sitting around reading, silently, taking notes, the atmosphere in here around these children made Beke feel unconformable, not his kind of thing. Soon he finds himself stood in front of an elderly man with grey hair, a long nose, long wrinkly fingers, the old man was wearing a thick woolen cloak. Even Beke knew better then to interrupt this particular man.</p>

          <p>After a few moments the mans voice booms out "Late".</p>
          <p>"S-sorry Mr. David I had to clean as punishment for.." his eyes drift off and memories of the incident start to come back, but before he could clearly remember.. </p>
            
          <p> "I don't want your excuses, do your cleaning then run here tomorrow. Now let's see what your aptitude is, place your hand on here, quickly now."</p>

          <p>"aptitude?" before he can talk any more his hand is dragged over a small rock, it looks like the ocean it's self is stored inside the rock, the reflection never sitting still. Soon after his hand is placed on the rock it turns to a light sea green. "Well, was not expecting that, maybe I judged you too quickly." Beke looks up confused at his statement "Sorry?"</p>

          <p>"Expected you to be a Fighter, seems you are a Rouge"</p>

          <p>"No, no, that can't be I must be a fighter, my brothers are fighters, my farther my mother, my whole family are all fighters!"</p>

          <p>"That is not how this works, Rouges are outside today, on your right as you leave, can't miss them." David goes back to his paper work. Beke looks on for a moment before realising he has been dismissed there is no arguing, he puts on foot in front of the other walking back to the door he came in from thinking over and over, no, it has to be wrong.</p>

          <p>Beke makes his way over to the Rogue group, the children around him are still moving in weird ways. The adult teaching them walks over to Beke. "So you are a Rogue then? Best to see what kind."</p>

          <p>"What kind?" Beke looks around. "Like what animal I am?"</p>

          <p>"Ahahaha, no, no. Don't know much about Rogues do you? Alright let's start from the beginning"</p>

          <!-- Shit about rouges -->
          <h3>Training</h3>
          <p>While the other children trained and practiced Beke was taken to one side and asked what he knew.</p>

          <p>"So Beke why did you want to be a Fighter?"</p>

          <p>"My whole family are Fighters, I would of been a really good fighter, I am stronger and larger then the others my age."</p>

          <p>hmm I do see your point, but let me clear some things up. Firstly Rogues are not Fighters who mimic animal moves, anyone can do that. If someone want to fight while acting like a monkey or a snake that is up to them but that is not exactly what is going on here. You see Fighters move mana throughout their bodies to increase their speed, strength or even defend from attacks this much you might already know from your parents. A Rogue however uses their mana to reproduce how monsters fight. It's not so much about the movements but how they use their mana, let me show you.</p>

          <p>No sooner had he stopped talking a large black tail, as long as his own body had appeared behind him and slammed into the ground, the ground fell and gave way to its quick and powerful strike. "Scorpion tail, that is my spirit."</p>

          <p>"So I can grow extra body parts, parts of monsters to help me fight!?"</p>

          <p>"Aha well yes" he gestures towards his own tail. "However also no. It is not about having extra body parts, although you can, I've even seen a man who replaced his eyes with that of a bird of prey, made him an amazing archer. The point is being a Rouge is about taking what advantages a monster has and making them or own. From level 1 though to 10 we mimic the monster we want to steal from, learn how they fight so that we can kill them, eat their heart and take their spirit for our own."</p>

          <p>"Eat their heart? gain their spirit? Are you saying if I eat the heart of a dragon I can grow wings and breathe fire?"</p>

          <p>"Maybe, I never known anyone who bested a dragon in single combat and then ate the dragons heart, so what abilities and skills can be learned from a dragon I do not know. But I do know you should not pick a dragon as your first target."</p>

          <p>"I don't think a dog or a cat would suit me."</p>

          <p>"You are right about that, like you said you are big and strong, since you are later then your class mates to level you will not reach level 10 as quickly as them, perhaps you should aim a little higher, something that suits you."</p>

          <p>Beke for once in his life, stops, takes pause and thinks about what would suit him.</p>

          <p>"You don't have to decide right this second you know, there are records of other Rouges you could see what abilities they got before you decide. For today since you came with your sword and shield, let us train basic fighting."</p>

          <p>With a nod Beke agrees and joins the group.</p>
          <h4>Effi POV</h4>

          <p>So Strength increase the physical damage you do, and magic how much magical damage you do. Vitality how long you can survive, this includes resistance to poisons. Willpower, and endurance are fairy self explanatory. Dexterity affects your speed, reaction time, how precise you are, those sort of things. Sense is not just detecting traps but sensing someones mood and many other things and finally your charisma or charm i've heard it called both but it affects how amiable people are towards you.</p>

          <h4>Beke POV</h4>
          <!-- Lunch and discussion of the others  -->
          <p>After training with the others in the Rogue group, Beke started to like it, although his level was lower he was popular with the others who wanted to train against a new opponent and made a few new friends.</p>
          <p>Beke places his lunch try down and looks around at his group of Rogues, the Fighters sitting on other tables. "So where did Nils end up, as a mage?"</p>
          <p>"Oh, no he is practicing to be an artist, I hear he's going to go to the Capital to train"</p>
          <p>"Oh, what about Effi?" Beke says with a little disgust.</p>
          <p>"The stone turned red for her, Fighter"</p>
          <p>"A Fighter!? How could a coward like that become a Fighter?"</p>
          <p>Silence filled the table. "What about Otto, did he even turn up?"</p>
          <p>"... Purple, mage."</p>
          <p>"Ha! He couldn't cast a spell even WHEN his life depended on it"</p>
          <p>More silence.</p>

          <!-- Lessons -->
          <h4>Skill tree lesson - Otto</h4>
          <p>After being directed away by an old man behind a desk I was facing a room of other children like me sitting on the floor off to the side of the main entrance. There was about 14 like me in total and a tall skinny man at the front, his boney hand gestured for me to sit down anywhere. As soon as I had he carried on speaking as if I had always been here.</p>

          <p>"If you remember from earlier Luis told us that when you unlock your first level, you will have access to your skill trees. These trees are where you can spend your skill points to acquire new abilities or just improve your current abilities."</p>

          <p>"You all have 2 skill trees right now. Your class, for you all sitting here today that is Mage. If you put points into this skill tree you will increase the amount of mana you have, learn magic spells and other wondrous things. Your second tree is your race, for everyone here today that is clearly Human. For other races such as elves from the Mifuegan League and naga from the empire, their race tree will not be human but of their own race."</p>

          <p>"Today we will be looking at the Human skill tree. This skill tree is often overlooked by not only combat focused people but also other races. While other races might get direct combat related skills and buffs the human skill tree is mostly focused around the charisma stat. This is the most overlooked stat in my opinion but you can make up your own mind."</p>

          <p>Over the course of the day we made notes and learned about the various skills and advantages and of course the disadvantages the human skill tree. The overall gist being that the human skill tree made humans appear more trustworthy, liked and various boots while in a party. This made humans particularly in large numbers, and political environments.</p>

      <h3>Arrival</h3>
      <!-- <p>first year of military school, need some parts about the travel above? </p> -->
      <p>Effi and her small group arrive on the outskirts of Grafen, this city has no castle instead hosting a military training camp to the north of the city. The city itself was the crossing point for the main route for trade traveling from the south of Alden to the north. It sat across the Norbadsu river which led from the West to the North. The city had walls, a large market place and a shanty town built up in the shadow of the side of the Southern wall. Grafen was inside the province of Lormersia which was the seat of Duke Reinhold of House Graf, a house that has long been counts and other forms of nobility though the ages. With a population of almost 12,000 it was the largest town in the province.</p>

      <p>The group would get opportunity to explore the town during their two year stay here but they would in fact be staying at the camp just outside of the town. Arriving at the gates to the camp they are stopped by guards before checking their belongings, papers and identities. After which they made their way into the encampment towards the paved square in the middle of the camp which was overlooked by a stone building which appeared to be a small palace. The plaza was filled with several groups of new recruits making 8 lines queuing to older looking men sat behind wooden creates they used as desks.</p>

      <p>When it was Effi's turn she approached the desk she could see there was a mana stone on the desk just like the one back in the village hall, scrolls of paper and ink pots and keys. The man asked her to put her hand over the manastone, it glowed red as expected, he took her name, age & where she was from. He then handed her a scroll and a key. "Read it carefully, if you cannot read I will read it to you and then sign the bottom with your blood." Effi read though the document, it was as expected a contract to join the military academy as a fighter with what was expected of her and what would be provided to her all layed out. She pricked her palm and dripped the blood onto the scroll which gave off a faint light. The man took back the scroll and stored it in a crate he had behind him and handed Effi a copy. "It's not important that you keep it unless you are unsure if we are treating you badly, in which case you will need to to refer to." She folded it neatly and placed it inside her inside pocket. She gave a quick bow to the man behind the desk who dismissed her and she went to find 'IIG1' the place she was allocated.</p>

      -->
      <p>Arriving at the halls, she could see rectangle wooden buildings layed out before her. 3 floors tall, not very wide but at least 5 rooms long. In the middle was a swimming pool sized grass area, with 3 buildings either side and 2 top and bottom for a total of 10 halls.</p> 
      
      <p>In the middle of the area surrounded by the buildings was a flag pole and adorning the top was a square flag with deep red background, same as the color of the manastone turns for fighters and a silver "II". Thinking to herself that this must be area II she decades to just walk from building to building until she finds G.</p>

      <p>G was on the left side in the middle, they where in alphabetical order starting from the right hand side making its way around clockwise. She firstly knocks on the door and waits and a short reply comes back though the door". "It's open you don't have to knock, you live here now" came a very confident yet not overly loud voice from beyond the door.</p>

      <p>Feeling a bit embarrassed Effi pushed open the door and looked around, when coming in she could see shoe shelves left and right of her, some shoes next to tags with the room numbers written on them. She found her own and put her boots and decided to leave her boots on the floor as they where quite muddy. Stepping up past he shoe racks to the left was a kitchen area and to the right was a seating area with a fireplace, although no fire was lit. Sitting inside was a boy of the same age. Very straight black hair, long on top and spikes up towards the right, back and sides cut short pointing down. He was leading back into a chair legs crossed in front of him without much of a care to anything. Wearing loose woollen top and tight brown leather trousers with a metal discs attached from the belt loop at the front around and up to the belt look at the back. He had no shoes on which seem to be the house rule, bright yellow eyes, Effi had never seen another person with yellow eyes before and got very distracted by them.</p>

      <p>"If you are done staring.. allowed me to introduce myself."</p>

      <p>"I wasn't.."</p>

      <p>"Please, it's not my first time, my eyes are rare after all. Let's not lie to each other we are going to be fighting together soon." he stands and bows. "I am Naoki, and no I am not from Leikia but my parents were. My role in the party is "DPS", a damage dealer."</p>

      <p> "Ah, I am Effi, I come from Steinauhau, I am going to be a tank. But how do you know we are going to be in the same party?"</p>
     
      <p> "Well there is two groups of 5 if you want to look at it that way but in the military and this academy a unit is made of 10, 5 would just be a squad. As you might of noticed there are 10 houses in II company and as you might guess 10 units makes 1 company."</p>

      <p>"Is there anything else I should know?"</p>
      
      <p>"Oh right, I mean all the military stuff I was just reading off the posters painted onto the walls" he points to large posters painted directly on the cream colored walls each with information. "They put it up so we don't forget. Apart from that I also just arrived 2 days ago, so if you like I can show you around."</p>

      <div class="pop">Poster<img height="500px" class="popOut" src="./images/ranks.png" alt="Ranks"></div>

      <p>Effi looks at a poster about the ranks in the military then turns to Naoki and says "Please I just arrived and really want to get the dirt off myself."</p>

      <!-- layout of the camp -->
      <!-- <p>There is 8km between the main road north and the end of the province boarder where the river bends north.</p> -->
      <h4> - Change of Pov to Naoki - </h4>
      <p>"So the base is home to serval companies starting with I, II, III, IV... and so on. The layout of each of these for both the first and second years is the same so I think we can skip visiting them all."</p>

      <p>"There are store houses, armory's and stables and just areas to store things in general under the walls, the archer ramparts above them. In the middle is the officers quarters, main armory and parade square. The buildings in that area are all for officer's even the pub so don't even think about joining them."</p>

      <p>"ohh do we get our on pub?"</p>

      <p>"Aha, no, unfortunately not. We doo get some relaxation, you may thank Leikia for the bathhouses that can be found on the south side, although there are no hot springs there is a sunna and warm baths to be found."</p>

      <p>"Ah I can't wait to try them, we never had a sauna or bathhouse in Steinauhau, but why must I thank the people of Leikia?"</p>

      <p>"Well it is not apart of the normal culture here in Alden but for the people of Leikia it is integral to their everyday lives. Now the reason we have one here is because officers of Alden who spent time in Leikia training their officers liked them so much."</p>

      <p>"I see. Well either way I cannot wait to try them" Effi gestures to her dirty attire</p>

      <p>"Aha, well yes that is why I am taking you there, I won't be joining you of course the bathhouses are split by gender so get those thoughts out of your head. I trust you remember the way back."</p>

      <p>Red faced Effie replies "I was thinking no such thing!"</p>

      <p>Naoki just smiles. "Well there is a small library if you are interested in reading nothing but military writings. Other then that everything 'fun' is inside the city of Graf."</p>

      <p>"Do you think we will get much time off?"</p>

      <p>"3 days a month, which day depends on your schedule. If you finish in the top 10% of that month you get an extra day off. Although the examination types change each month so it is unlikely you'll place highly every month."</p>

      <p>Effi makes a competitive face showing her determination to be the best. At the sight of this Naoki just rolls his eyes.</p>

      <p>"And here we are." Naoki gestures towards a wooden building interrupting the normal layout of the camp, where another companies area should of been was the bathhouses.</p>

      <p>"Thank you for showing me around" Effi bows</p>

      <p>"I did not really show you around, although I did plan on it all I did was take you straight to the bathhouse. I could smell you coming before you even knocked."</p>

      <p>Effi with a red face "Hey! It was a long journey here." Naoki just smiles and waves as he walks away.</p>

      <h3>Training</h3>
      <h4>POV Effi</h4>
      <p>As secluded, the relaxed atmosphere all ended on the first day of training. The officers had made their way back from protecting new recruits on the road to the camp, along with the second years from missions they had been sent on during the start of June.</p>

      <p>Effi and troop where lined up in the parade ground in room order. There where to the left and right of them units from the same company, across the square where other companies all first years all with an officer standing before them. Stood above them all looking out over them a small wooden platform had been assembled in front of the stone building. Upon it was the commander officer for this training regiment.</p>

      <p>His voice rang out around the parade square. "Speech"</p>

    <!-- Monthly assessments in different areas -->
    <!-- Physical, willpower, physical damage, tactical command, knowledge, party, unit, stamina, total endurance, duels, scouting, logistics, swimming, rowing, sea battles, capture the flag -->

    <p>Company II where sent to one of the training fields around the camp. They line up all facing forward towards the officer of their company. He was an aged man, with short grey hair, a well trimmed grey beard a heavy stare but his face still seemed friendly. He had a mix of hardened leather armor with metal plates on his elbows and under his shoulder guards. Attached to his left hip was an officers single handed sword. The blade looked to be about 80cm (32 inches).</p>

    <h4>POV Change to Friedrich</h4>

    <p>"Welcome to company II. I am Friedrich Odeck, from the province of Odeck. I will be your company commander for the next 2 years. You will be taught by myself and other officers throughout the years but I will be in charge of your wellbeing, cleanliness and discipline"</p>
    
    <p>"I trust you have all had time to bathe, before changing into the kit provided. I see no one was foolish enough this year to turn up dressed in anything else." As I said so I was looking over the students, while most thought it was to size them up it was really to try and match their faces to the description given on the paper.Every year I would dread getting a new company, learning all their faces, personalities, names. I often wished I was like the other officers who either did not bother or called them all by the same name, but that is not my style.</p>

    <p>"Which nicely brings us to the most important part of today, the rules. They will help keep you safe, not just from accidents but also from being punished." Switching the paper from the bottom to the top to remind me of the camp rules.</p>

    <p>"During your time on duty you are to remain in the uniforms provided. This means that even when you are no longer training and just walking to the bathhouse, meeting a friend in the plaza or even in your own houses you are to wear the causal uniform provided, and when you are expected to be training with an officer you will wear the formal uniform provided. If this makes sense nod your heads in agreement." Watching the students nod I can't help but thick back to the mistakes I made my first time teaching by asking them if they understood, a mistake to be sure all I would get back is random replies and questions.</p>

    <p>"You cannot leave the camp walls without permission, this includes on your off days. If you want to leave the camp on your days off you must be signed out by an officer. For your days off to make things smoother I sign them before hand so you can collect them without disturbing me, and for those who are a pain I make sure to burn their slip in the fire." It's good to let them know their are consequences, but also to follow up on them, this one is easy to remember.</p>

    <p>"Lastly, no fighting outside of training, follow officers orders when given and clean up any mess you see, if it is your own or not. If you disagree with any of these rules or break them the repercussions are as follows."</p>

    <p>"first a verbal warning, or gesture from an officer. If you miss this warning thats your problem. Second a verbal in your face warning, you won't miss this one and it will come with a duty you have to preform, cleaning something usually. Finally removal from the area, if you refuse to remove your self the officer *** in charge of camp behavior, or his goons will come and remove you by force. You're welcome to fight them provided you are seeking a painful and twisted death." I think I will get BBQ tonight, fed up of stew and bread.</p>

    <p>"To add to this I have my own rules. Often you hear your elders say things like quite, which means to talk quietly. When really they want you to be silent. I will say silence when I want silence and there shall be no confusion." Roast chicken does sound good though.</p>

    <p>"When referring to officers you may call me Officer Odeck, not Friedrich. You maybe also call me Sir or Officer. If it is another officer you do not know the name off stick to Sir, Madam or Officer" I've decided it's going to be chicken.</p>

    <p>"Finally, and most importantly, don't have sex with each other, when you break up it will make everything awkward. You have to fight as a unit together for another 2 years."</p>

    <p>"If you have questions or anything to say, raise your hand and wait silently to be called on, if not remain standing and silent." </p>

    <p>A hand goes up from F house. "Present yourself, state your name, rank and question" a student steps forward, average looking student really. Dark brown hair, brown eyes little on the skinny side.</p>

    <p>"Sigmand sir, Levi sir, So if we break the rules and get taken away, what happens to us?"</p>

    <p>Friedrich raises an eye brow and waits for the student to add "Sir" to the end of that question then replies. "Honestly, I am not too sure. Depends on what you did really. From my side all I see is that you come back ready to participate and follow orders, if it takes a week or a month or not at all, that's on you really." Well it's not a lie, I am not 100% sure in every case, they just take them to a holding area sit them against a wall and ram the desk up to them so they cannot move and are forced to work there, unless they are violent, may the god have mercy on the violent ones.</p>

    <p>Another hand goes up. "Step forth." "Hannah Sir, Levi Sir, What if we are continuously told off but not taken away? Sir"</p>

    <p>"Why? you planning on being a pain Hannah? You have a meeting with me, if that fails a meeting with my superior, if that fails. You will be whipped in front of all the students to set an example, and either kept in holding or sent to another camp."</p>

    <p>Some of the students turn a little pale from this, I imagine they have seen similar whippings used as punishment in their villages before. If they are from the cities I would be willing to bet on it.</p>

    <p>"Look, just don't do anything, and if you are told to stop doing something just apologize even if you don't think you where doing anything wrong. Better safe then sorry. Now let's get you training. You'll be doing one week in your roles, one week in your party, one week in your unit and then a week of assessments. Since it is week one we will be splitting up here I will stay with the support here and we will have all the Tanks over by that tree, all the DPS over by that hill."</p>
    <!-- End of Fredrich POV -->
    <h4>Effi POV</h4>
    <p>There was 20 others in the tank group, a mixture of boys and girls. Mother would often tell us tales of battles long past where the women of Alden would kill the men from their own country if he was caught fleeing from battle. I knew the stories where true but I was still expecting most of the camp to be boys, I am glad I was wrong.</p>

    <!-- maybe write this later -->
    <p>The lesson was simple, we started off comparing levels then it was about the role of tanks, what they should do during a fight. What weapons are useful and not for the role, quick practices with all kinds of weapons and shields. After practicing with various partners and getting to know each other a bit more Effi soon found out of all the tanks her level was very average if not on the low side, the instructor said they would have to work in their units to slay more monsters and level up to at least 10 by next month.</p>

    <p>Once lunch was over they went over holding the monsters attention, if the monster was to attack someone other then the tank, someone with less endurance, less vitality they would die very quickly, thus the tanks job was to protect the rest of the group by holding the monsters attention and taking the damage for them. This is why the class suited Effi, she wanted to protect those share cared about. Protect the rest of her family from the fate her sister had met.</p>
    
    <p>With the approval of her teacher Effi spent one of her skill points in learning the skill "Provoke" which forced a single targets focus on her for a short period of time and made her the targets first to attack in the unit. They practiced with the help of each other and the teacher until the afternoon. It was now time to go back get have a second lunch and study.</p>

    <p>Once she had made it back to her room Effi changed into her casual uniform and put her formal uniform though a quick hand wash in the washing area downstairs next to the kitchen and left it out to dry. While washing her clothes she had a quick check up on her stats.</p>
<!-- Charge, Moves quickly in a straight line
Heavy blow, High damage output strike, long cool down
Battle shout, Increases the stats of allies -- not collected 
Strength up, Increases Strength(+) (Prime number str)
Vitality up, Increases Vitality(+) (Prime number vit)
High impact, Smashes the ground or target causing an AOE -- not collected until after mace
Shield Bash
Provoke, Provoke and tease them so that they want to attack you. -->
    <p class="stats">
      <li>Name: Effi.</li>
      <li>Level: 6.</li>
      <li>Primary Class: Fighter.</li>
      <li>Skills: 6.</li>
      <li>Titles: 0.</li>
      <li>Skill points: 0.</li>
      <li>Stat points: 0.</li>
      <li>Stats:</li>
      <li>Strength: 2</li>
      <li>Vitality: 8</li>
      <li>Endurance: 6</li>
      <li>Magic: 0</li>
      <li>Willpower: 0</li>
      <li>Dexterity: 0</li>
      <li>Sense: 1</li>
      <li>Charisma: 2</li>
    </p>

    <p>She put her stat points into vitality and endurance evenly until now. Now she found out that as a tank she would also be needing strength, and possibly willpower if they fought magic monsters, it might be a common tactic to cover for this weakness by the 2nd tank in a unit having high willpower and her high physical but Effi wanted to be able to protect them from ALL monsters.</p>

    <p>If this was her plan, she might become a very defensive tank, but not very quick, not able to sense traps or changes and not very persuasive and would have to rely on others anyway, "why can't I just be good at everything?"</p>

    <p>Inside the common room she noticed she was not the only one who decided to study with the others and noticed that Sophia, Emilia, Ehrhart & Charlotte had also come into the common room to study. Since Effi knew Sophia the most, both being tanks she decided to see if Sophia would study with her.</p>

    <p>"Hey so, do you mind if I join you?"</p>
    <p>"Sure! you don't have to be so formal you know? You did spend 30 minutes trying to slam a sword into me just now"</p>
    <p>"Aha, well trying is the keyword there.." Sitting down at the table with Sophia, Effi lays her three books and sits.</p>
    <p>"You brought the rules book with you?"</p>
    <p>"Oh I kinda just grabbed all of them."</p>
    <p>"Well I was reading though the history's if you want we could pick out paths that suit ourselves and maybe compliment each other since we will be fighting together"</p>
    <p>"oh that sounds like a good idea, I kinda know what I want, well the result anyway I am just not sure about how to get there. What skills to pick up, what balance my stats should be..."</p>
    <p>"I think we are all in that boat, well most of us anyway. Charlotte over there is unsure of even were to start" At the mention of her name Charlotte just smiles, reading the history's also.</p>
    <p>"Yeah, picking out what you want to do with the rest of you life right now is really stressful.."</p>
    <p>"Well I am thinking a large battle axe a lot of strength and vitality, the power to shake the very ground with my blows, kind thing excites me. What did you have in mind?"</p>
    <p>"Oh wow that sounds bad-ass! I was thinking a big shield with a longsword."</p>
    <p>"hmm, I mean would you take some advice from me? from what I saw today you are naturally quite strong but not very fast. That was why your strikes where very easy to avoid or push away maybe a sword isn't your thing but something...heavier? so you can put that strength to use."</p>
    <p>"Ah, yeah mother always said I was slow with a sword, but until now I never tried any of these weapons before.. I'll read the history's with you now and see what I should do at level 10 maybe it will help me make a choice"</p>
    <p>"Sounds like a good idea"</p>

    <h4>Dinner time</h4>
    <p>"I cannot decide"</p>
    <p>"On your sub-class?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah, Paladin or Knight, Paladins are great they protect people and have great defensive and even some healing skills but are so inflexible where as knights have so much freedom."</p>
    <p>"Ah yes the knight is the most popular sub-class for fighters, the jack of all trades. I think all first years go though the same dilemma"</p>
    <p>"What about you?"</p>
    <p>"Easy choice, Barbarian! After reading the stories of warrior women I decided to become as famous as Blenda! You do know her right?"</p>
    <p>The woman who lead and army of women against the Empire when they tried to attack us while we were defenseless and proved to all of Alden woman where better then men? of course I have!</p>
    <p>Johannes - "We all have been reading the history last night, it says equal to men!"</p>
    <p>Sophia - "You wanna die?"</p>
    <p>Johannes - "S-sorry"</p>

    <p>"Where is Konrad? Is he not eating with us?"</p>
    <p>*cough* "Err he's..."</p>
    <p>"He's flirting with the girls from fourth company, I don't know why you are so shy to say so."</p>
    <p>"He's...Urgh, whatever."</p>

      <h3>Missions</h3>
    <!-- defeating monsters in the local area -->
    <h4>POV - </h4>
    <p>One week after the start of lessons they all students where moved from their classes in their roles into their parties of 5. They had four days to practice and get their teamwork together because on the 5th day they would be fighting a real monster together. Company II had decided on teams of:</p>

    <p>Effi, Naoki, Alajos, Johannes & Konrad.</p>
    <p>Sophia, Emilia, Klara, Charlotte & Ehrhart.</p>

    <p>Fredrich - "So to repeat what you have to do in short, learn to work together as a functional team, there are various activities you will be assigned to each whole or half day depends on the activity. I will be around but unable to simply stay with each party all the time that would be unfair on the others. Take the activities seriously even if they are fun, difficult or boring" as on the 5th day your life might depend on it. Dismissed."</p>

    <p>In turn the team captain from each team made their way to the front and picked up a wooden baton with an activity on the reverse side.</p>

    <p>"What did we get?"</p>
    <p>"Assault course, half day. Swap with puzzles"</p>
    <p>"So we have to complete and assault course as a team?"</p>
    <p>"Well yeah I guess it so"</p>
    
    <p>After arriving at the assault course it because very clear this was not something someone could do solo. Their first obstacle alone was a giant wall higher then any two of them even stood atop each other.</p>
    <p>"So... Thoughts, ideas?"</p>
    <p>"Well if we can get one or two of us up there, even then if they hand there hands down unless any of you can jump twice your own height..."</p>
    <p>"Let's see if we can get someone on top maybe there is more to this."</p>
    <p>"Well Effi well have to hold whoever goes up, but we will need another on top of her for them to be able to make it to the top."</p>
    <p>"Why am I on the bottom!?"</p>
    <p>"You're the sturdiest... You are the Tank."</p>
    <p>"...stupid logic"</p>
    <p>"I'll stand in the middle, to give 'support' to the one that goes up"</p>
    <p>"Was that a pun about your role?"</p>
    <p>"Just get on with it"</p>
    <p>Effi is stood with Konrad standing on her shoulders with Naoki and Johannes holding them from either side. Alajos starts climbing up them thinking this would of been easier if he started on top, once he climbs on top of Konrads shoulders he grips onto the top of the wall and pulls himself up.</p>
    <p>"So, what can you see?"</p>
    <p>"Another wall"</p>
    <p>"Don't joke whats up there"</p>
    <p>"It was not a joke."</p>
    <p>The group fall silent. Suddenly the end of a rope falls down from over the wall. "One at a time, there is no where to tie the rope onto so its just me holding it."</p>

     <p>Once atop the wall they could see Alajos was not joking it was another wall, but thankfully this one had a door inside.</p>
     <p>"So what is it this time?"</p>
     <p>"well truth be told the only thing up here was that rope, so let's try the door."</p>
     <p>Opening the door the party made their way inside, inside was a pathway that they could see the end of, it led to a cave exiting out the other side and the sunlight could be seen pouring inside. The only issue was that the pathway was not wide, in fact it was as wide as a person foot was wide. and on one side was a sheer drop and the other a wall.</p>
     <p>"So, think the rope is long enough to reach the other end?"</p>
     <p>"Nope, not even half way."</p>
     <p>"Should we go one at a time?"</p>
     <p>"and if you should slip and fall we morn you one at a time?"</p>
     <p>"I was only asking.."</p>
     <p>"Sorry, it just kind of came out. We are meant to do this together, theres enough rope to wrap around each of us so we are tied together and walk across together. If one of us should slip the others could help them stay up"</p>
     <p>"And if two of us slip?"</p>
     <p>"mm just don't think like that"</p>
     <p>"So, since the officers made this, do you think the drop is really fatal, I mean how far down could it even be, we only climbed one wall."</p>
     <p>"I mean, only one way to find out. I can't see the bottom but once you are down there you could shout back up how far it is."</p>
     <p>"I get the point"</p>
     <!-- puzzles -->

     <!-- giant wall, river, skyscraper, lasers, trap areas,  -->

     <p>"What even this time?"</p>
     <p>"Make a camp, campfire, tents, food, water and sleep there for the night."</p>
     <p>"Sounds easy enough?"</p>
     <p>"Don't jinx it."</p>

     <p>Arriving at the campsite they could not help but question if it was the right place, just down from the river and next to the forest in the east side of the camp. There was no equipment, no food, no water nothing. </p>
    <!-- camping stay the night  -->
    <p>"Are we at the right place?"</p>
    <p>Konrad - "Yeah, I spoke to some of the girls from the other team, apparently you get nothing and can bring nothing to this activity. You just have to make what you can with your skills."</p>
    <p>"So thats what you were doing with those girls"</p>
    <p>"Mostly, but I don't kiss and tell."</p>
    <p>Effi starts fake vomiting</p>
    <p>Naoki - "Putting aside the fun, I don't want to sleep on the wet grass. So what skills do any of you have that could help us here?"</p>
    <p>Effi - "Well, I have heavy blow. It strikes a target for high damage, it never said I had to use a weapon or the target had to be living. Maybe I can cut us some wood?"</p>
    <p>Johannes - "I can sort of clean the river water by purifying it, but the mana cost is high. Just to be safe we should also boil it."</p>
    <p>Konrad - "Not really a skill, but I can track down food. My sense is quite high and I did pretty well back in my home town. I also learn the tracking skill, I just haven't made up my mind yet."</p>
    <p>Alajos - "While Konrad collects the vegetables and berries I can hunt. I have the spear throw skill and tracking skill, kind of must haves if you are going to live in Chinga...Northern Alden. Long live the GrandDuchy."</p>
    <p>The group fall into an awaked silence at the reminder of how the people of the old state of Chingaling are treated.</p>   
    <p>Naoki - "Effi, wood for fire, Johannes water, Konrad food, Alajos hunt until midday then make your way back for lunch even if you catch nothing and we can decide on how far we have all made progress before splitting up again. I will work on our accommodations."</p>
    <p>Konrad - "sounds good"</p>
    <p>Effi - "I'll get chopping!"</p>
    <p>The group go their separate ways.</p>
     <!-- follow pov char -->

     <!-- lunch time -->
     <p>At just past midday they make their way back to the meeting point, the place they agreed to make camp, Naoki had dug a small hole between two trees, and placed logs around the edges. On the bottom was layed sticks and leaves intertwined, the roof was partially built sloping off to one side made currently just out of sticks and a rope like plant.</p>

     <p>Alajos "Hey Naoki that's really impressive"</p>
     <p>"Thanks Alajos, you had luck hunting I see"</p>
     <p>Alajos - "No luck, all talent."</p>
     <p>Alajos - "Now help me skin these things we can eat the rabbit now, the birds tonight."</p>
     <p>Naoki - "Yeah alright"</p>
     <p>"The shelter will keep the rain of us, what should we do for warmth?"</p>
     <p>"Fire, body warmth and hopefully I can get some help making small blankets out of these plants."</p>
     <p>"I'll give you a hand after, not sure the Alden's have any practice at making their own shelter."</p>
     <p>"Ha, that is true thanks man."</p>

     <p>Late that night the party are sitting around eating the berries, vegetables and birds by fireside. The sun had gone down and Fredrich had come to visit them.</p>
     <p>Fredrich - "Evening all."</p>
     <p>The party stand, salute and greet their commander. "Sir!"</p>
     <p>Fredrich - "Good, sit. Now the night will be cold, somewhere around 5 or 6 degrees. While your accommodations look promising I decided to bring you blankets. Tell no one." Fredrich dumps a package of blankets wrapped with string into Naoki's lap, as soon as he does he turns and walks back to the camp.</p>
     <p>"Well that was unexpected."</p>
     <p>"But very welcome, let's get to bed"</p>

     <!-- Monster fight -->

     <p>Effi picked up a baton from the table and took it back to the group. Turning it over in front of all of them they could see what monster they would have to fight.On the back side was a picture of a of a wild dog-like animal with a tail longer then its body. One word below it Ahuizotl.</p>

     <p>"What is this?"</p>
     <p>Alajos - "Ahuizotl, It's a strong monster. From the jungles of Chaibia, thick fur that acts as its defence against most weapons, small ears and a long tail or in this case 2, at the end of which will either be a hand like paw or stinger. Both are dangerous, its element is water, usually they hide in the depths and drag men under with their hand like tail."</p>

     <p>"So what should we do to prepare?"</p>
     <p>Alajos- "Hmm if its the stinger we will need cures for poison, if its the hand, chances are its a water arena and we will need to prepare for that, hard to say."</p>
     <p>Naoki - "I think we should level up, getting some of us to level 10 will really help."</p>
     <p>"You are not wrong but how do we do that?"</p>
     <p>Naoki - "The orders where to prepare for the upcoming fight, it never specified how. Why don't we go and hunt monsters?"</p>
     <p>The group reflect on Naoki's suggestion, after agreeing to it they go to Fredrich and ask for passes to leave the camp.</p>

     <h4>POV </h4>
     <p>Fredrich - "Well, you are not wrong, or even the first to ask. It is unusual for first years to take up monster slaying missions so early on, but I won't stop you, just suggest that you stick to missions in the 0-10 range. Even if you are in a group, level 10 is such a large change that it might be too difficult."</p>
     <p>Taking the slips the party bow and thank their officer.</p>

     <p>"Which mission did you grab?"</p>
     <p>"Well the choice was slimes or living mushrooms, that was all that was in our rank range. So I picked the mushrooms, levels range from 0 to 5."</p>
     <p>"Let's get to it!"</p>

     <p>After searching though the woods in the area given to them on a map the party soon came across a group of living mushrooms, Effi quickly used charge and glided into the first living mushroom smashing into it with her shield grabbing the attention of the monsters.</p>

     <p>Naoki runs up behind Effi and strikes the first monster with his katana, Naoki soon pulled back when he realised he had done less then 3% damage to the monster.</p>

     <p>Konrad and Alajos both use charge at the same time to move into range of the mushroom and attack using "quick strike" cutting the hp of the mushroom down by 6% each.</p>

     <p>Johannes used "quick strike" with his bow and arrow stuck the monster for another 6%. "This is going to take awhile"</p>

     <p>Soon enough the mushrooms fight back sending spores into the air and the closets charges awkwardly head first at Effi. Who just allowed it to slam into the shield and hit down on top of it with her sword using "heavy strike".</p>

     <p>"Did it hurt how much damage?"</p>
     <p>"1 hp. I think we can just slaughter them, Johannes you got our backs if we mess up?"</p>
     <p>Johannes - "I am sure I can out cure 1 hp damage"</p>
     <p>The group fight their way though the mushrooms easily, after having completed the mission they make their way back and grab another. Over the course of the week the group managed to level a few times but did not once try to fight anything above level 9.</p>

      <p>Alajos - "Huszár of course."</p>
      <p>Naoki - Waving his katana around "Samurai, like you even had to ask" he laughs.</p>

      <h4>POV</h4>
      <p>"How long until the fight?"</p>
      <p>"We are up next so as soon as the other party finish we go on after."</p>
      <p>"Ah I hate the waiting.."</p>

      <p>"Company II, Unit G, Part 1."</p>
      <p>"Well that's us, lets go."</p>
      <p>Making their way onto the arena, in front of them was a cage holding a twin-tailed Ahuizotl. Its fur was a dark blue, eyes black, so black there where no other shades of color inside. The two tails circled around over its head poised to strike.</p>
      <p>Effi takes to the front while as practiced Naoki supports her from her right side, her weakest side. For this fight Effi swapped her sword for a large one handed mace, hoping this was the right call to make since the Ahuizotl's fur made using slashing weapons very hard.</p>

      <p>Once the fight started the Ahuizotl wasted no time in pouncing towards Naoki only to be "provoked" by Effi, The first attack came in the form of two claws which struck down on her shield. Naoki saw his opportunity and unleashed a a devastating "quick draw" into the monsters nose, the damage was done and first blood was drawn. With a quick whip of its tail two stingers where sent flying towards Effi and Naoki, the former who took the hit with her shield and the latter with his shoulder.</p>

      <p>While Naoki fell down in pain Johannes shot loose an arrow of healing which stuck Naoki in the back causing the wound to heal slowly, the only problem was the poison was still taking his life.</p>

      <p>Alajos had not been idle using his new increased speed to sweep around and launch an attack from the monsters flank, striking with his saber into the monsters rear leg. When the monster spun to attack him he made a hasty retreat back to Konrad, who had arrived with a light thin sword in one hand and a bag of powder in another. He quickly threw the powder into the monsters face after it had turned to help Alajos's escape.</p>

      <p>Effi who was angered by her partners injury and having lost the monsters attention used "Heavy blow" into the monster behind, the heavy mace was very effective the feeling of crushing bones and flesh came back as a response, she followed this up with a "shield bash" into the monsters face as it tired to turn around. Now with its full attention Effi continues to attack with her heavy mace.</p>

      <p>Johannes moves to pull back Naoki, he insists he is okay the officers will pull him out if is hp drops below 20%, he moves back behind Effi and strikes to cover her weaknesses. Alajos moves in and out striking from the flank and sides of the monster. Konrad moves in to deploy spikes onto the ground, he is a little too aggressive and the monster lands a strike with his tail onto konrad, Johannes keeps him from falling too low but the tacs are deployed poorly.</p>

      <p>The monster moves to jump and bite down on Effi's sword arm but it is quickly met by Naoki's sword and a cut is left across the monsters eye. Konrad who has been weakened moves back only for the monster to to retreat from Naoki's blow, with the tacs now layed between Effi and Konrad.</p>

      <p>The monster jumps to Konrad, unable to move in and grab the attention of the monster because they could not move easily though the tacs and chose to move around Konrad's scream rang out around the area has the bite had gone deep into his arm, his sharp sword in though the monsters throat.</p>

      <p>Effi slams the mace into the side of the monsters face to get him to back up and release Konrad, amazingly it works. Johannes tries to heal Konrad has his hp hovers around 30%. Effi enraged gives chase and "charges" after the monster.</p>

      <p>The monster bleeding from the neck turns and charges into Effi, but it is of little use to fight with its claws or mouth against Effi's shield, but its tails can make it around the shield. Alajos moved in quickly to deal as much damage as he could to the monsters legs, they where cut and weak from Alajos's repeat attacks.</p>

      <p>Alajos shouts "Watch out! Breath attack!" The monsters jaw opened unrealistically wide, a blue water mist came out of the monsters breath. Effi jumped back in surprise as Naoki moves in and lunges his sword into the monsters mouth before dispersing into the miss and a bright light.</p>

      <p>Effi shouted and ran in a charge towards the monster, though the breath she felt her movements become slower the moment she came into contact with the breath. Naoki was on the ground near by and the monster had now a slash across both its eyes. Flailing around attacking randomly at any and all noises Effi banged her mace against her shield to keep its attention. Johannes quickly fired shots into Naoki once the mist had cleared up, the monsters hp was getting low, blood pouring from its neck, both eyes injured and its back legs shredded. Alajos and Konrad charged in landing heavy & quick blows onto the monster its hp soon wilted down to nothing.</p>

      <p>The party had, with the safety next of the staff and officers defeated a level 10 opponent for the first time, and realised how large the jump was between their abilities and monsters of the same level. It took 5 of them to take down just 1 monster of similar level.</p>

      <p>With the joy of victory came more fruit for Effi as she too had finally become level 10 and was able to pick her sub-class.</p>

<p>"So what did you pick?"</p>
<p>"I went with paladin, for access to some useful skills.. I was going to go knight, but I will take that when we get another sub class at level 50."</p>
<p>"50!? Most civilians stop around level 30~40. Are you going to join the full army or become a monster hunter?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I might do both in my life, but I want to at least climb to level 50."</p>
<p>"It'll be tough, Fredrich has been fighting for years and he's between 50 and 69."</p>
<p>Alajos - "So, which of the Shwazen Deities did you pick as you patron"</p>
<p>Effi - "Oh I didn't, not yet. You need a skill point to unlock faith spells so I don't have to decide right now."</p>
<p>Alajos - "Theres still time to pick a from Sunaudirism."</p>
<p>Effi - "Aha I'll keep that in mind."</p>

<h3>Mock battles</h3>
<!-- battles against other units, companies -->
<p>The week following the party trials each unit was put into compilation against two of the other units from their company. With no idea who they are up against the group decide to make plans in the common room.</p>

<p>The group formation of 2 tanks, 4 dps, 2 support and 2 healers originated from fighting monsters it would of been more ideal if they all used similar weapons when fighting other humans but they would just have to make it work.</p>

<p>Naoki - "Since we are all at such a low level this will just turn into a brawl anyway, it's not like we have even started training in formations or with discipline."</p>

<p>Klara - "I think Naoki is right, it is unlikely we can do anything complicated as we will just lose our plan the moment it starts. Everyone knows we should take out the healers then the support & dps and finally the tanks."</p>

<h3>Competition</h3>
<p>The day came sooner then it felt like it should. Standing on the grassy field opposite another group of 10. With mace in one hand and a shield in the other, I took to the front facing down our opponents IIC, a party from the same company who we had trained with in the past.</p>

<p>The day was warm the sun shone from out right giving no edge to either party. Soon time for my mind to wonder on such thoughts past and a loud ringing noise was given off by a metal drum. Time to move.</p>

<p>Pulsing my legs left and right I moved in a slight zig zag movement towards our opponents, the first to meet my mace was a large broad man with a long round shield in one hand and a axe in the other. My mace shook his shield and he replied in kind with his axe. Rather then meet such a force, I ducked down and rolled right and charged into a blonde boy with twin sabers, slamming my shield into him stopping him from charging my team.</p>

<p>I turned to see that the man with the axe had chased me down, soon I felt the cold bite of his steel axe take a chunk of my flesh. I unleashed a growling scream from my depths as I swung my shield to protect my side, peddling my feet to move back to keep them both within my eyes.</p>

<p>Trying to keep the attention on me and give my team room to move I slammed my mace into the floor using the fighters skill high impact. This cause small damage to those around me focusing their attention back onto me. As my opponents moved in I gave a great shout with the skill battle shout, firming up the stats of myself and allies near by. Hopefully there where allies near by. As my vision filled with the light from the edge of the axe I protected myself with my shield and pushed the head of my mace into his shield to keep it off me.</p>

<p>Soon I was hit in the side by one of the blonde boys sabers, pain shot down my right arm but I knew I could not let him move away from me. I activated my taunt skill to keep him focused on me by spitting directly into his face. Even if just for a few extra seconds keeping him away from the rest of my team would be worth it.</p>

<p>The battle between us three continued back and forth, I was left on the defensive as was my role, my health started to fall as I continued to take their attacks despite my defensive style, I would not be able to hold out against them forever. Defeating them was beyond debate. </p>

<p>A thud hit the back of my helm, weirdly it did not sting like an arrow should but instead Johannes had healed me in his own spacial way.</p>

<p>They had tried to ignore Sophia thinking she was a heavy tank, while it us true she is a tank, with a lot of points into strength ignoring her was their mistake.</p>

    <!-- tank challenges -->
    <h2>Tank trials!</h2>
    <!-- <p>Effi POV</p> -->
    <p>Excited and nervous, the big day for tank roles has arrived. The trials for the tank class are similar every year so although they are easy to predict and prepare for that does not make them easy to pass. The first trial is physical endurance, the tank will have to withstand physical attacks until they drop the longer you can stand the more points you acquire. This is repeated for magical and mixed magical & physical attacks. After the first 3 trials the tanks have to be tested on their ability to hold the agro of an opponent, the longer they can keep a great blood hound focused on them and not the large pile of meat the more points they get.</p>

    <p>I walked to arena with Sophia, the arena for these matches was the usual arena for the matches between students. </p>
    <!-- scouting challenges -->
    <h2>Scouting Sport</h2>
    <p>Scouting trails vary each year, but they are all a kind of hide and seek. This year the target to seek is a wolpertinger, you will receive more points for the type and speed in which it is obtained and returned to the camp. However the hiding part of the challenge is to avoid the Bahkauv found throughout the forest. They appear as a small calf with fangs claws and a long tail, they mostly appear in around sources of water, so the challenge level is not too high, but they do prey on the children of Alden who wonder too far alone.</p>

    <!-- damage challenges -->
    <h2>Damage Dealing</h2>
    <p>This event sounded easy on paper, who ever inflicts more damage is the winner. The catch? Actually hitting the target. Elwetritsch, a chicken like creature with scales in place of feathers, although it's wings are useless it sure can run, dodge and if cornered their scales will protect them long enough to land their beaks into you. Who ever kills their Elwetritsch first, wins. Simple.</p>

    <h2>Team captain showdown!</h2>
    <p>This is the most grueling challenge of all the other challenges, only team captains may participate and the rate of failure far exceeds the other challenges. In just 6 hours the team captains compete against each other for points, being tested on leadership, battle tactics, personal skills and logistics. That's right, it's a written exam!</p>

            <h2>Beke - Second Year</h2>
          </header>
          <h3>One year since leaving the village.</h3>

          <p>Time sure flew by quick, I did not return home for the winter or the summer like the other students. Truth be told I was happy to be rid of the other village students, my family I would of liked to of seen but no doubt they still judge me for being a Rogue.</p>

          <p>To think I hate being a Rogue at first, it suits me. My first solo kill was a brown boar. Even with the Rogue skills I picked up on the way it was no easy fight, but compared to what came after.. I'd rather not go though that experience again.</p>

          <p>After the boar had chocked out its last breath of life a small whispy light blue orb appeared above the boar. Something like it's spirit I guess, whatever it was I had to eat whole, then once it was inside me I had to circulate my mana and break down the orb into my mana and move the contents to my brain. For the next 6 hours I thought I was a boar, I moved like it did, I did the things it would of done before dieing. I lived as a boar for a few short hours and his memories became mine. It would be weird enough to share the memories of another human, but a boar, somethings you just want to unsee.</p>

          <p>I gained power though, put all my points into vitality and strength. The skills though, I ignored the human skills, I even ignored most Rogue skills, no what I picked where the skills of the Boar. Thick fat, Olfaction, Hoof Protrusion, etc. By just age 15 I had already reached level 17, I was aiming to reach level 20 before I turned 20. If I couldn't do that I was no combat class but a civilian. I once heard that the archduke's eldest son had reached level 30 betime he was 20, but with that much money I am sure even I could do that!</p>

          <!-- Thick fat - ignore damage less then an amount
          Olfaction - great smell 
          Hoof Protrusion - rough / flat terrain + // bad at swimming and snow+sand.
          boar rush - big charge attack
          Charge!
          Dermal Armor
          Enhanced Bite
          Enhanced Endurance
          Enhanced Hearing
          Enhanced Smell
          Enhanced Strength
          Enhanced Speed
          Expanded View
          Tusk Protrusion
          Wild boar Physiology: Enhanced Strength, Feral Mind, Environmental Adaptation
          Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): If the boar takes 7 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 Hit Points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.
                  -->

          <p>I came back from my morning training to sit and each breakfast with the other students, all the second year students had reached level 10 and absorbed a spirit already but some were clearly better then others and I would not associate with trash that took the spirit of a dog or a rat. My associates, Kraft, Markolf, Anselm & Sieger. All from Alden non of them from Banderdam, no I might as well of absorbed the spirit of a mouse if I was to associate with their kind either. We beat them in the war, they should show us some respect.</p>

          <p>Making my way over to the the breakfast table and squeezing in between Markolf & Anselm. "Todays the day." I gave Markolf a nudge with my arm. He knew what I meant. For the past month we had been researching and tracking a flower-horn. It gets its name from the flowers that bloom from it's many horns, depending on the color of flowers you can determine where it was born. It has four thick legs, the older ones often have mushrooms and other fungi growing up the side, a large mouth and a thin short tail. Most noticeable however is the large mound on its back with a hole on top. Here rain water collects along with whatever else happens to drop inside perhaps thinking the collection of water and this slow wondering creature only eat plants. Nothing could be further from the truth, once inside what lays beneath the surface of the water is another smaller mouth, powerful enough to crush and pull you in for digestion.</p>

          <div class="pop">Banderdam<img class="popOut" height="400px" src="./images/forestthing.jpg" alt="Banderdam"></div>

          <p>Today was the day our little band was to attack it, today was the day that Chingaling Soós Krisztián would die. That short weasel faced scum was put into our group during the start of our time here. It's got to the point where I can't stand the smell of him anymore, the way he speaks, the way he acts even the way he eats disgusts me. We are told by the government that they are Alden's people, but we don't see it that way, and neither do they. Thinking about this made me too mad too eat. I left the breakfast hall and threw my bread at the back of the head of one of those savages.</p>

          <!-- forestthing.jpg/png -->

          <p>The grass outside was set wet, I made my way from the dinning tent back to my room. I changed from my training gear into our combat outfits, heading back out and to the gathering point just past the camp and on the edge of the forest.</p>

          <p>Shortly the others started dripping in until our team leader Norbert had shown up and we set off, I was upfront as always with my new outstanding sense of smell and thick hide I made a good vanguard all by myself. Kraft, Markolf, Anselm & Sieger where all damage dealers behind me, Norbert was the second tank and stayed at the back while traveling. Soós and his friend Yvonne where a healer and support, both useless.</p>

          <p>We walked though the thick forest, the trees were spaced out near the camp, the floor lined with leaves, dirt and whatever else fell in a forest. This part of the forest was well traveled by humans, and cultivated to be this way. Further in was our prize. Where the forest became thick, the ground less traveled by humans. Some believed the inner forests to be unwalkable, the trees close together and the ground littered with forest degree, I believe they have never seen the size of the monsters lurking in the forest, they are more then large enough to move the trees apart and crush all below them into a fine flat paste.</p>

          <p>We walked for hours before finally that familia smell grew stronger, one I have been tracking the movements of for weeks. We moved to get closer and closer, there in a clearing eating it's way though a fawn was a flower-horn. They too where a type of Rogue able to absorb the spirits of its prey, this one was somewhere between level 25 and 29. It should in theory be a good target for us to hunt without any deaths, but just dangerous enough that a death would not be suspicious.</p>

          <!-- POV change to Norbert -->

          <h4>POV Norbert</h4>

          <p>The flower-horn looked like a cross between a fat bellied boar and a tree. The horns which grew from the top of its head instead of tusks bloomed a soft pink flower, this kind of color was quite common as it meant the creature was born near by in this forest.</p>

          <p>Time to take action before we are spotted, it's eye on our side was facing the floor, almost sad looking, i'm told they always look that way. I would send our damage dealers to the flanks, Beke would be sent to the right to guard them, he's proven time and again he will not protect Soós even though he is the healer. Yvonne would be sent to the left to help the faster ones dive in and out of the battle. I strode forward when I saw the team was in position and Beke had stepped too far forward and alerted the beats to our presence, slamming the flat side of my axe against my shield I provoked the beat to me, it quickly charged, I activated Badger Fur and tanked the damage, 32% of my health. I struck back with my axe and activated Berserk-Badger, my attack stat raised for a short time. Less then 1% of it's health dropped. I smiled to myself, this would be a long fight, the damage dealers where all spider/snake builds and one fire-salamander that despite it's name also gave venomous skills. As you can imagine a forest creature like this had high resistances to venom.</p>

          <p>As the fight progressed the damage dealers on the left would sweep in quick strike and flee, Yvonne would kick up dirt, sticks and other degree to cover their retreat. Beke would provoke it and his team would take over while I received healing. Beke was a better build for a tank no doubt but he had no leadership qualities and was too unstable to be a main tank.</p>

          <p>It's health was dropping, it was becoming slow, its dark amber blood made the floor around it sticky. We were doing well dropping it's health about 6% ~ 10% per rotation, soon enough the creature became desperate and activated some kind of rage skill similar to my berserk. The left wing swept in and jumped away with just one attack each, now it was too dangerous to be caught trying to land more damage onto it. In came the right wing and back to me, I provoked the beast slammed my shield into it and sliced down into its head with my axe, it was coated in thick amber blood. Soon the beast turned from me without reason, it charged to Beke and Soós who was healing Beke before he would come back to me, all I could see was the creatures behind and hear Soós's scream as his leg was crushed under the beats hoof, the lower half of his face crushed by it's powerful jaw his eyes a mixture of blood and tears looking distraught in death. We had practiced for so long, we had studied it's movements, we had studied past battles and sort wisdom from our officers, even while berserk the beast should still of been provoked by me, and either tank strong enough to hold back the beast even if it charged.</p>

          <p>How? How? How? Soon I lost my calm mind and rushed in swinging my axe and screaming in a berserk rage. It was not long before the beast who was in the throws of death joined Soós.</p>

          <!-- Change to Kraft -->
          <h4>Pov Kraft</h4>
          <p>Soós lay dead, Beke was the most suspect not the flower-horn. He had never liked Soós and even spoke about him meeting and accident, usually such talk was met by silence and his own laughter as if he did not feel the air in the room. Norbert who would be blamed for his parties failure was going berserk, red in the face screaming at Beke who just kept that ugly smile of his and played it off like he had no part in it. With Markolf & Anselm the only others on the right flank i'm sure the official stories will be that no one saw anything, it's not that they like Beke, but the hassle would be less if Soós's death could be cleanly blamed on the monster and Norbert's failure.</p>

          <p>Yvonne was stood by my side, Sieger by hers. She wore a face of shock, horror and well, her friend just died she was distraught. With Norbert screaming at Beke and Beke's guilty smile she should know what went down. Sieger just looked to the sky, as if he was praying to take flight and leave this situation.</p>

          <p>Back at the camp the officers took us aside one by one, what good that would do since we had been together all day and asked us what happened. Naturally no one saw anything, Yvonne and Norbert blamed Beke with no evidence. The officers removed Norbert of leadership and tried to give it to me. I refused. For that I was put into holding for 7 days. Sitting on the stone floor behind bars I would not find out what the outcome was until I was released, better they just disband this group but they won't. Who ever accepts the command of that group instead of declining would be a fool.</p>

          <h2>POV Beke</h2>
          <p>I stepped out from the holding cells a free man breathing the foul air deep into my lungs. Yeah they held me for a few days, asked some questions but I knew and they knew no one really cared what happened out there, just another dead savage from the wastes. Even their homeland seeks to push them away, wet, thick rain forests swarming with monsters. One even told me deep in the forests there are areas where the grass gave way under you and swallows you whole. The land itself must be desperate to get good blood back into it.</p>

          <p>A creased and crumpled paper was sitting in my pocket as I ran my finger over it, thinking back to what one of the investigators had said. He had given me this paper and said they where looking for men with the will power to do what needed to be done. Walked off right after. It was an address of one of the other groups in the camp. Second years, rich kind it seemed.</p>

          <p>Although all students were given the same accommodations, on the outside. After a few weeks passed it became clear the rules where different depending on which family you came from. No servants where allowed in the camp, but that didn't stop some students using their wealth, power and influence to turn the other students into servants for them for 2 years. I don't care, a man gets what he takes, their fathers just took more then mine, but I will take more then them.</p>

          <p>After knocking on the door it quickly swung open to a pretty boys face. Blonde hair, blue eyes, tall and lean, the kind of Alden you think about when you talk about the nobility. He gave a sly half smile, the kind that made him look like he was up to no good. The kind that made you want to punch him square in the face.</p>

          <p>Noble - "You must be Beke, we had heard you have talent. Do come in, there is beer, masato & pálinka in the cabinet help yourself."</p>

          -->

          <p>Beke - "I'll taken Alden beer, you can keep the the savages piss-water, or better yet throw it."</p>

          <p>noble - "Ahaha, I knew I would like you. The cabinet only has Alden beer and republic whisky inside. Had to test you, you understand right?"</p>

          <p>Beke - "Keeping out the savages of east? Yeah I get it."</p>

          <p>Soon enough the room was filled with fancy sorts. I couldn't deny it though, they where strong. The people of Alden had various hair colours, eye colours. Hell it even encompassed the lands of lesser cultures who could not stand on their own. Brown hair, eyes, blue eyes, blonde hair but what stood out most was the girl was deep blue hair which became lighter towards the tips until it was as if invisible threads. Her eyes did not shine, but where a deep endless blue. They looked purer then water itself.</p>

          <p>Noble - "Now we are all gathered here. I would like to introduce the reason we are here, Beke." He pointed to me with his whole hand palm face up, and added. "And for Beke may I introduce our little group, The protective order of Alden." He gestured around to the people filling the room.</p>

          <p>Beke - "The protective order of Alden? Protected from what precisely?"</p>

          <p>Noble - "Ah that, yes we are the protective order of Alden, we protect Alden from ... the influences of the more savage aspects inside and outside of Alden." He smiled at me as if to try to push the rest of the message entirely though my mind.</p>

          <p>Beke - "That sounds like an idea I could get behind and support. So what is this? An initiation? An offer?"</p>

          <p>Noble - "Ah, an offer to join of course. We could always use more like minded people, with skills to match."</p>

          <p>Beke - "What is it I have to do?"</p>

          <p>Noble - "Ah, for now nothing, but in the future we put our own kind first and once you are in a good position you return the favour by helping more of our kind. You get me?"</p>

          <p>I nodded, a big grin overtook my face, seemed like luck had really taken a shine to me. From being accused of murder to friend of nobility all within a few hours. We had a small party after, drinks, food and got to know each other. The girl with the stunning blue eyes was the daughter of a duke from Basel close to the border regions, as for her eyes and hair, I did not ask. The other students where mostly minor nobility or the offspring of people in high positions, as for the nobel who let me to start with, he was named Thomas von Absberg he was a noble with a high position from Grafen.</p>

          <h3>Travel</h3>

          <p>The students of the village would all head off on the same day, they would travel to septate destinations and along the way change the adults traveling with them, at first the instructors of the village hall traveled with them until they reached the town of Todtenwei. From there they would change guardians every town/village or city until their destinations. Between Todtenwei and Shomberg was the 2nd Regiment of Aldens camp, there where many Fighters who would join the training camps near by and once the remainder of the group joined the main road south they lost the majority of the other students are the large Grafen military training camp. The group would further split at the Lobach river where the 3rd regiment of Alden where based, those heading north from here went to the capital Alden or Banderdam near the Mages academy. South would be heading Haisengen and then into Huonhia. The group would continue to split and have new students join all the way until Argavereri. Although the journey to this point had been as expected where small monsters where driven off by the numbers or guardians the road to Banderdam traveled close to Huonhia and near an area often overrun by monsters. It was a rainforest where a few major rivers became one and followed into the sea, if it where not for the abundance of monsters it is likely this would be the location of some major cities.</p>

          <p>Otto found himself walking next to a tall boy with short brown hair. He had the makings of a small mustache on his upper lip, a refined pointed nose and a bit of acne around his cheeks.</p>
          <p>"Names Leon, if you care to ask"</p>
          <p>"Oh sorry, was I starring?"</p>
          <p>"Maybe a little, and we have been walking next to each for for 2 days now."</p>
          <p>"Ah, I am sorry..."</p>
          <p>"It's fine, you from far? you look tired, like you have been walking for awhile."</p>
          <p>"Steinauhau"</p>
          <p>"...doesn't get much further then that in Alden, you ever been to Chingaling land before?"</p>
          <p>"Chingaling? I am going to Tirnavalli Dukedom. Banderdam."</p>
          <p>"Ah, sorry forgot my place, thats correct, how silly of me."</p>
          <p>"What is Chingaling land?"</p>
          <p>Leon stared at Otto. "You really don't know?"</p>
          <p>"wouldn't of asked if I did."</p>
          <p>"Suppose so, thought you were just a die hard Alden, well Chingaling was a country before, made up of people from Hathapatson to Dodgud. Alden and Huonhia split the country in two and claimed it for their own. Although the official story is the people of Banderdam where demon worshipers so Alden occupied that area and Huonhia occupied the rest to protect the people from Alden. I suppose the truth depends on who you ask."</p>
          <p>"So you must be local then?"</p>
          <p>"Aha, yeah, born in Banderdam. Still live there now with my little sister and little brother."</p>
          <p>"Erm your parents?"</p>
          <p>"Monsters, Ethautenheim to Banderdam passes though the province of Bilkotgopia. Risky trip but pays well, work at Banderdam depends on the ports and the academy. Both do poorly in the winter."</p>
          <p>"So you make this trip every year?"</p>
          <p>"First time. I didn't dare go outside of when the students travel, less guards. Less of the ones that will help you anyway."</p>
          <p>"Makes sense you can blend in easily because of your age, is it not a risk for you to tell me all this?"</p>
          <p>"No, not particularly. It is no crime to travel at the same time, and traveling in numbers offers its own kind of protection."</p>
          <p>"Well I am glad to have you with me, if we get lost you must know the area."</p>
          <p>"That is true, but I am no fighter, I am training as a shop keeper, an apprentice. You know, if I get back."</p>
          <p>"You'll make it back, I am sure. There are nobles kids in this group the guard's won't let the monsters near them."</p>
          <p>"Yes, near them. But we are not them."</p>
          <p>Otto pauses to think, he has a point but if we are just near by they will have to protect us even if they don't mean to.</p>

          <p>Leon - "you're a mage with no wand? I think that is fine I have seen loads of mages without wands. If you really have to have a wand you can pick one up in Banderdam, being so close to the Mages collage means they often stock those kind of things."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I still want to get one though"</p>
          <p> Leon - "Yeah, looking at Pal's shop it seems many students think the same way, maybe it's the books they make you all read brainwashing you into buying wands."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Aha, you might be right you know, we all have to read the same books to start with."</p>
          <p>Otto - "There is a lot of noise coming from those nobles up ahead. Didn't think they could get any louder."</p>
          <p>Leon - "Drunk no doubt. Sounds like they are play fighting."</p>
          <p>Otto and Leon turn to look at each other realising there is no way they are play fighting like little kids at a time like this.</p>
          <p>Leon - "Into the northern tree's, if we are lucky we can go around."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Won't there just be more monsters in the trees?"</p>
          <p>Leon - "Chance of monsters is still lower then defiantly monsters"</p>
          <p>Otto - "But the guards." Before Otto can finish his sentence he see's a nobles guard cut down a 14 year old girl from neck though the body and out though the opposite side just above the hip. To far to hear what the guard said it looked as if they had turned on the other students. Following Leon, Otto ran as fast as he could until they where just beyond the sounds of metal, shouts and screams.</p>
          <p>Sitting inside of a ditch with hastily assembled twigs, leaves and dirt above their heads Otto was looking pale as Leon tried to slow his breathing.</p>
          <p>Leon - "Welcome to Bilkotgopia."</p>
          <p>Otto - "That some kind of joke?"</p>
          <p>Leon - "Yeah, sorry. A dark one, close to the truth. In Bilkotgopia people go missing, it's always blamed on the monsters but strong monsters rarely travel across into Alden."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Truth and lies must be hard to tell apart here."</p>
          <p>Leon - "Yeah, at least im upfront about which side I am on, I won't be turning against you. I just want to go home."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Like you said you are not a fighter, but can you guide us to the river just past this... mess"</p>
          <p>Leon - "Polite way to put it, but yes I can. After that we follow the river takes us to Banderdam."</p>
          <p>Otto - "The river safe?"</p>
          <p>Leon - "Ahem.. once we get out of Bilkotgopia it is."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Let's move before we have time to take in what happened or worse it comes this way."</p>
          <p>Leon nods and they crawl out and make their way though the forest towards the river, any sound of battle had died out they where too far from the road now to hear anything anyway. After 90 minutes of walking they where getting to where they wanted to be, Leon had been following signs and markings left behind by his people, signs to help them avoid the guards but Otto did not need to know that.</p>
          <p>Leon - "Can you hear. Moaning?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Like an old man waking up."</p>
          <p>Pushing apart the branches Leon peered forward and in front of him on the ground was a dead student & the upper half of a dead man. The dead student was a first year, 14 years old like all the others the same age as Otto and Leon. She had light brown hair, slim body and face, with a small pointed nose. The half of the man that was left had blood seeping out of the cracks between his burnt skin, there was no hair on his body and his lower lip was completely removed along with his ears. He was currently eating the girls insides though her belly tearing at the flesh with his hands of bone and burnt rotten flesh, shoveling the meat into his mouth where most of it ended up back inside the girl though the gaps in his teeth.</p>
          <p>Leon vomited, loudly. The monster screamed towards Leon and dragged it's self at surprising speed towards him. Otto having seen Leon vomit had rushed over to help him, upon hearing the scream and seeing the moving cadaver chasing them down he tried to push his mana though his body and out of his hand like he had with the Kappa. The rush felt easier this time with all the practice he had had the ball of light shined, pale blue glow shone off the ground and trees before the ball spiraled forward blinding the monster for a moment giving Otto the chance to free Leon of his short sword, Otto ran towards the monster and kicked dirt up into its eyes and mouth, it flailed about and pushed the dirt from its eyes before showing his teeth in a growl. Using this time Otto ran in a circle to the side of the monster before turning on his heel, running straight for the monster holding the blade by his side and lunging it into the creatures head.</p>
          <p>Otto wondered if there would be another level up or notification, but nothing happened. Letting go of the blade and turning to help Leon back up Otto heard a low growl and turned to see the monster was not dead and moving about with a sword sticking out from its head. Otto jumped around as the monster made swings from the ground before grabbing hold of Leon's sword again and swinging it smashing the monsters head to pieces over and over.</p>

          <p>Leaving Leon against a tree to recover himself Otto starts to search the dead student, finding on her some coins, accessories and a few school supplies and food.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Guess she wasn't a rich girl." Grabbing the ID card 'Lea Müller'. "You know her?"</p>
          <p>Leon - "No, Alden name, not from here."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Makes sense, can't carry her so I will take the ID card to the town and report shes dead or something. Let's get out of here."</p>

          <p>Making their way back to the river Otto and Leon where on the other side of the river to the main route. Since they had passed into Tirnavalli they could see a few boats moving down the river, and a few coming up. They manage to flag down some passing guards and explained their story to them, Otto gave over the students ID and told them where they could find the bodies. Otto and Leon then joined them in the boat on the way to Banderdam. </p>

          <h3>City of Banderdam</h3>
          <p>Arriving before the city of Banderdam where trails of students heading to the academy which lay near the city. The city itself was across a small stone bridge across the river Chitna which ended just short of the cities gate house where a wooden drawbridge made up for gap. There where square shaped towers all around the walls spaced apart, with a wooden building built atop. The gate house seem to of been rebuilt with different color to it, the towers were circular with stone walls to the pointed rooves. There was a walled and rooved walkway between the two towers visible from the outside as it ran over the gate house giving the defenders room to drop things onto attacks. Even the older towers and walls had matriculations.</p>
          <div class="pop">Banderdam<img class="popOut" height="400px" src="./images/sergei-panin-04.jpg" alt="Banderdam"></div>

          <p>After getting out of the boat at the temporary station set up to deal with the large influx of people Leon and Otto made there way to the town by foot.</p>

          <p>Once at the gate, guards where outside checking people coming into the city. With his ID card, letters of introduction to the magic academy and his age it was easy for Otto to pass though the gate. Leon lived there so he was able to pass though the smaller gate for the locals. Meeting up again inside Leon took Otto to the shopping district so he could drop off his package and Otto could go shopping for a wand.</p>

          <p>The town inside was packed, the buildings clearly had been built with space between them to avoid fires but smaller temporary structures, carts and peddlers had set up in those spaces selling and buying goods coming and going from the ports of Tirnadepal and Tirnavalli. There were of course also goods being sold especially this time of year for new and old students entering the academy.</p>

          <p>Leon had taken Otto to a wand shop that had been there since before Banderdam was apart of Alden. Inside was clean, really clean. Not a single spec of dust was anywhere to be found, the wands were displayed around the shop in glass cases and up on the walls in glass cases. Each wand had a card next to it with its description and price.</p>

            -->

            <p>To put it bluntly, it was hard to miss. That wand stood out from the others, and not in a way that made him want to buy it. While thinking what kind of mad man would make such a thing let alone sell it his thoughts where interrupted.</p>
            <p>"First time? I wouldn't recommend that particular one"</p>
            <p>"Uh yeah, it's my first time here. I won't be getting that one, what even is it?"</p>
            <p>"Ah, not all items are made, some are dropped by monsters so it's hard to say. Let me help you out, this is my shop I can do at least that much, names Pal" He said his hand stretched out.</p>
            <!-- pall means Tiny, petite -->
            <p>True to his name he was a small man no more then 150cm, Otto reached out and shook his hand.</p>
            <p>"So first tell me, do you know what field you would like to go into?"</p>
            <p>"I am not too sure myself, I know I want to take the elements electric & wind."</p>
            <p>"Ah, a battle mage then?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, sorry I should have specified."</p>
            <p>"A mage who apiologies, rare."</p>
            <p>"Are other mages rude? Is it only those with bad parents who become mages?"</p>
            <p>"Ahaha, might be so, we just say it is because they think they are gifted more then others. Makes them arrogant, if you keep away from being arrogant and stick to what you want, you might just activate it. But don't speak like that around other mages, you won't make friends that way ahaha."</p>
            <p>The shop keeper layed out 3 wands before Otto. "Nothing quite as fancy as some of the other wands, but at least useable by a beginner. Now I should explain the stats displayed are reflective of my measurements, thats to say how much it would increase by stats by just to give people a point of reference. The stats for when you hold it will be reflective of your own level."</p>
            <p>"Oh, I did not know that.. Can I ask, what level are you?"</p>
            <p>"33, I have spent more of my life as a shop keeper, item collector and appraiser. Combat magic is not my specialty. I would of liked to of gotten a second element but as you can see I did quite well enough without it." The old shop keeper smiled.</p>
            <p>"I cannot deny that." looking at the wands they had the cards displaying: {+3 Magic.}, {Once per day skill: Detect magic (1).}, {Once per day skill: Small gust (1).} Each had their own uses, the first wand would give Otto +0 magic until he reached level 10 however, but every 1 magic at any level is always a boon. Detect magic would be great if he ever got to go on a mission in helping find anything magical, and without having to spend a spell point to learn it. Small gust was a wind element skill, a support skill, all it did was as it was named, a small gust of wind would pass by, maybe to pick up sand or dirt and throw it into the targets eyes, or dry clothes. Even so to find an elemental item a beginner can use was rare.</p>
            <p>"Ah you like that one? Hard to find an elemental wand that anyone can use, but since it is a first level spell it is something you can learn for free."</p>
            <p>"Not free, costs a point."</p>
            <p>"That, is true."</p>
            <p>"How much are they?"</p>
            <p>"Same price, ¤100,000"</p>
            <p>"Less then I thought, more then I have."</p>
            <p>"Only students from nobel houses pay with cash anyway, if you sign for something I can collect it later at the academy and they take it from your mission rewards, until they are paid back. Don't go crazy though they won't loan a first year more then ¤100,000."</p>
            <p>"Good thing the prices match then."</p>
            <p>"Don't look at me like that, I already discounted them so you could afford it if you like them, I won't force you, no doubt you will be coming back for many years."</p>
            <p>"Ah, thank you" Otto bows deeply. "Could I buy the detect magic wand?"</p>
            <p>"Feeling you might get lucky on a mission?"</p>
            <p>"The opposite, feel like I will be unlucky and not spot something."</p>
            <p>"It's yours, if I where you I'd keep it to yourself. Although it gives you access to the skill, still costs mana, you have to push your mana into the wand, though it and out the other side. Normally I ask people not to test wands in here but in this case it won't do any harm so give it ago."</p>
            <p>"If you are sure." Otto pushes his mana into the wand, it flows though like his arm is longer then normal feeling apart of him as far as the mana is concerned and out the other side where upon Otto's eye sight is filled in color. Almost all objects in the shop glow different strange colours.</p>
            <p>"Quite the show isn't  it? Almost every item in here contains magic so, thats why."</p>
            <p>"Why are there so many colours?"</p>
            <p>"Different types of magic, like the manastone when you touch it turns purple-ish right?"</p>
            <p>"Yeah"</p>
            <p>"Well" taking a mana stone out from his desk and leaving it in the palm of his hand, the stone turns from its usual sea blue to dark forest green."Wood is my element."</p>
            <p>Otto nods in understanding. After thanking the shop keeper again and leaving the shop with his new wand hidden away, heading to meet Leon at 'Főzelékfaló' a small cafe in the castle area, he ordered Főzelék as Leon had recommended it. An interesting experience, tasted like thick vegetable stew although that description does it little justice, so Otto became desperate to learn how to make it.</p>

            <div class="pop">Főzelék<img class="popOut" height="400px" src="./images/Főzelék.jpg" alt="Főzelék"></div>

            <p>"Good isn't  it?"</p>
            <p>"Yeah, I don't really know how to describe it, can you make it?"</p>
            <p>"Yeah I can, but not as well. If you want to learn my sister will be able to show you, I am sure you will get time to come visit us the minimum stay in the academy is 2 years after all."</p>
            <p>"I will, it's not like there are other towns near the academy, so I guess I will be coming often."</p>
            <p>"Aha you're welcome to, but you studies might be a little more intense then you think."</p>

            <p>After thanking Leon showing him where to get a good meal, and introducing him to a reliable shop keeper. Otto's journey to the Academy was only a few short hours walk from Banderdam, although the other students often chose to spend their money on rented mounts, Otto could not ride, and was bankrupt.</p>

          <h3>Academy</h3>
          <p>The academy at first appeared to be a large and quite impressive but much smaller building than expected, situated inside the rainforest Banderdam was famous for. With tall tress hiding the building from a clear view, as you got closer to the building you could see vines growing up the side of the stone work, towers with no tops poked out from behind here and there, the place appeared to be in ruin in areas. Students could be seen on mounts, in carriages or on foot, unloading near the entrance. There where two large doors left wide open, standing near by where men dressed in an assortment of all different colours most in robes but a few in metal armor. Inside of the two doors where you would expect there to be stairs or a great hall was two giant stone spikes, they resembled claws and reached 30m from the ground to their top where they stopped just shy of the roof. Between these pillars was a mass of dizzying, swirling purple liquid, a purple Otto knew well, it was the same purple he saw the manastone turn back in the village hall.</p>

          <h3>Inside</h3>
          <p>Once Otto stepped though the portal he could see stretched out before him a long white bridge winged with more trees leading to a large palace, the door 30m tall appeared to be made of gold, with towers pointing up around the structure and beyond who's rooves where lined and etched in gold. Even the dome which sat above the main gate house appeared to be made of gold, the rooves a light blue pointed like castle from fairy tales, the walls pure white like marble. The biggest change of all was that the rainforest was gone and replaced by towering mountains where the palace sat in the valley between.</p>
          <div class="pop">Academy<img class="popOut" height="400px" src="./images/academy7.jpg" alt="Academy"></div>

          <!-- stuff happens / sign up etc -->

          <p>Upon signing the scroll Otto felt warm and golden light bathed him. Then suddenly a message appeared in front of his eyes. "Title: Back to School - Enter the academy, +1 Magic". Otto was elated, he had only just joined and already his magic was increasing! Why was it called "Back to School?" if it is unlocked the first time you come? never mind. He quickly loaded his stats.</p>

          <p class="stats">

          <p>"Room ****" A key is place in his hand as he is pulled back to reality. Slightly embarrassed by his outbursts he quickly apologized</p>
          <p>"I am use to it, all commoners are the same when they first arrive."</p>
          <p>"Oh, I, sorry."</p>
          <p>"It's fine go find your room, there should be books and uniforms inside best to learn the rules before you break them."</p>
          <p>"Yes sir, thank you" Otto bows deeply before leaving to find his room.</p>

          <!-- Arrival at the room -->

          <p>Walking away from the main hall of the academy across other bridges and though streets, markets made of students and permitted merchants. They came with wagons, small shops in the bottom floor of housing the floor was layed in marble or stone. People wore either robes, with uniform markings but of different colours or bright colorful casual clothing. Otto was walking for while before realising he had surely come to the end of the large academy in this direction. The stone floor had turned to a dirt track, checking a nearby stone building for its housing number and checking it to his own he walked just a little further and saw the houses of stone had become wooden, although still nice. The rooves where pointed and curved at the end and looked like how he would imagine a house from Leika would be, trees stood around and he could hear birds singing. The houses in this area where built within or near trees and nature all around, the paths where grass which had been walked more often then the other areas. Wanting to look around some more Otto climbed one of the trees and looked into the distance, the forest was large, and in the distance he could see a very large structure where there was less trees, a huge wooden palace. There where several buildings inside and a small wall around the outside, unable to really be able to see any details from this distance he decided to drop down and keep on looking for his assigned room.</p>

          <p>After awhile he soon found a pathed road again, but rather then the neatly placed stones in a straight line he found randomly placed rocks between mud leading up the side of a cliff. The cliff had dwellings carved out of the rock, it was about 5 floors high. Looking back he could see cliffs on the opposing side, they had red painted pillars and a water fall falling between and atop them eleven dwellings with forests around, looking between the two cliffs the opposing cliff was much more welcoming.</p>

          <p>Walking to the door carved into the cliff Otto checked the sign carved into the rock beside the door. Yup, this was the building that matched his. There where a small set of stairs leading up to a large metal door placed inside of a natural looking cave entrance. The door was so large and heavy Otto doubted he could even open, that any man could open it. So he knocked and waited.</p>

          <p>A head popped out from a floor level window. "Who is it?" a girls voice came from inside and the head looking out responded "Another of the dammed, one of us." with a big smile and the door creaked and a portion of it opened only large enough for a single body to pass though. "Welcome home brother."</p>

          <p>Walking inside the main hall was much longer and deeper then he thought back into the cliff, a good 1km or so. Not wanting to explore around this place too much he noted that there where large stone pillars with rounded hat-like tops. Below the 'hats' where holes and inside was a glowing ball, these pillars where lining the hall all the way down lighting it. </p>

          <p>Pushing the door to his right, and looking inside was the boy from the window, two girls and another boy. Looking between them Otto decided he should introduce himself.</p>

          <p>"I am Otto I am looking for my assigned room, the start matches this buildings so I thought it was in here."</p>

          <p>Ralsan - "That'll be the case, 51? 5th floor, room 1. Ralsan is my name, this is Tisiel" A girl waved her hand, "Shrorlei Crerlass" the other girl waved quickly once with her hand, "finally we have Reingard". The final boy waved. "We are the next first years staying in this building also."</p>

          <p>Otto - "I see, why are we the 'dammed'?"</p>

          <p>Ralsan - "Ah that, to be placed all the way out here in this erm abode is because you must be poor, have no connections to anyone important and no outstanding talent. Nothing personal just how thigh higher ups view us, not to say all the poor reside here just those with no history, backing, connections, long distance cousins in high places. Basically people who cannot complain."</p>

          <p>Otto - "When passing though the military camps I had thought they placed all children of any standing in the same accommodations."</p>

          <p>Ralsan - "Well yes, but this is not a military camp, and if you take a closer look you will find they are not put into the same groups at least."</p>

          <p>Otto - "Another might be disappointed, but I look forward to being away from the noise of the town during the night at least."</p>

          <p>Ralsan - "Aha, honestly the rooms are not too bad go up and take a look, we will be here."</p>

          <p>Otto - "Ah thank you, it has been a long way."</p>

          <p>Otto headed up the stairs to the 5th floor, 1st room.</p>

          <!-- room inside -->

          <p>Inside there was a window, a desk & chair, a bed that would fit a man twice his size and a bin. Next to his feet this area was slightly lower down then the rest of the room, for about half a meter in in diameter, here was a small rack for his shoes and an old plant pot with an old umbrella inside.</p>

          <p>After removing his shoes Otto walks over to the bed where 3 uniforms are layed out on the bed, a black robe, with a smart looking pair of black trousers and t-shirt (school and class emblems etc). The next uniform was just a 2nd pair of trousers and t-shirt without any markings on. The final uniform was much softer and thinner, with a note that read "SLEEP WEAR" on top, maybe to save a first year of the embarrassment of turning up to class in pajamas.</p>

          <p>On the desk where some books, with a note that said "Read Chapter 1 of MM&M before first class." "Academy rules, regulations and assessment criteria", "Mages, Magic & Mana The basics" & "Exemplary mages: a history".</p>

          <p>Leaving his belongings and deciding not to change into his new clothes yet Otto headed back downstairs to see if he could learn more about the housing.</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "I'll show you about if you like, won't take too long not much out this way, then after why don't you go into town with me and buy me dinner as tanks" she teased with a sly smile</p>

          <p>Otto - "Be careful what you say, I might just take you up on that."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Let's start with the tour, some of the halls are dark, but I don't bite hard."</p>

          <p>Otto - "Pfft I'll keep you at a distance then."</p>

          <p>Tisiel took him around, there were shared bath's on each floor. Students slept and cooked on floors 2 - 4. On the first floor was a library, it was mostly unused and dusty, the only books to be found here where either centuries old or older students books left behind. Walking further down the main hall on the first floor they came to a large circular door. There where markings all around. There where 4 circles, 3 outer circles had these weird markings around them and the middle circle just had one symbol also nothing that Otto had seen before.</p>

          <p>Otto - "And this is?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Sex dungeon."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Aha, you have a strange sense of humor."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Fine you got me I have no idea what this is either, truth be told not sure anyone does. No one we asked know what it is."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Bad decor"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Aha, so how about that dinner?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Sounds good to me, I have no plans to cook tonight. Know any places?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Nowhere special but just past the Leika's area is the restaurants that are closest to here, they all seem fine to me."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Lead the way, I'll pay."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ohhh have you not spent the loan yet?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Ah, I mean. It's not really my money. We were attacked on the way here."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Do Alden gods not curse those who take from the dead?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Can't say I know of any curses but it is not like she will need it now."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "You are going to fit in here. Ahaha."</p>

          <p>Otto and Tisiel went out for dinner in the main town, she showed him around, there was more to do closer to the academy, from pubs, sports, gambling, dueling, and many other entertainments. The notable places around the main academy where the market areas, the main of which had a large church near by, the large arena, the academy's main library and mission office.</p>

          <p>After dinner they made their way back to the cliffside dorm. At the entrance to the door Tisiel spoke "I am home brother."</p>
          <p>To Otto's surprise the door spoke back. "Welcome home sister."</p>
          <p>Otto - "What was that?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ah, the password. The cliffside dorm is old, no one has explained how it works only that it does."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Well it is good to know how to get in, I was worried someone would always have to be inside."</p>

          <h3>Lessons</h3>
          <h4>POV Otto Lesson on mages</h4>
          <p>"Now who can tell me what separates a Mage does with their mana which separates them from the Fighters?"</p>
          <p>"They project their mana into the world around them to cause change"</p>
          <p>"Good, you should all already know that having read chapter 1 of MM&M."</p>
          <p>"Todays lesson is about getting you all understanding the directions you can take as a Mage, the roles can fill in Alden and beyond and of course where to put your points."</p>

          <!-- Elements - different types of mages -->
          <!-- Jobs mages do outside of combat -->
          <!-- Combat mages, how to spend your points -->
          <p>So since we are at that time combat mages, how to spend your points. Firstly Magic also affects the total amount of MP you have, so that is usually the main stat for Mages even if you plan to be a front line fighter, healer or non-combatant.</p>

          <p>Now the other stat points there is no formula for, so we have provided you a book containing what past mages have done and how it worked out for them you can either copy one of them or just learn from what they did and make your own path.</p>

          <p>Finally your spell points. These can be tricky you don't want to be investing all your points into an explosion style magic and then find yourself fighting with a sword, or worse, trying to farm.</p>

          <p>If there are any questions you will be seeing me once a day 4 days a week so please wait until you have read though  "Exemplary mages: a history" before asking questions as you might find your answers in there.</p>

          <p>The class shorty dismissed after, Otto went to the library along with many of the other students from his class and other first year classes. The main library was split into sections and first years who where not nobles of any kind could only access the first floor which soon became packed. Deciding he had the book he needed to read he would just go back to the cliffside.</p>

          <p>In the library on the cliffside Otto got to reading the histories by the light given off by the large stone pillars. After reading though so many of the Mages from the past he soon found himself bored and looking for anything else to distract him. He started looking along the spines of the old books around the library; 'Fire Magic', 'Faming with mana - Pocotcotcan magic', 'Lusty Ma...', 'The Summoner: Morian Zenas'. "Oh he's in the histories book, wonder if it's different".</p>
          
          <p>"I guess the people that wrote the histories just copied directly from these older books."</p>
          <p>Looking though the books again Otto finds a book half on its side, 'Otto Magnus Of Might' curious, Otto opened the book to find the pages had been cut cleanly and inside the book was a black key, and the number 34, and below it some strange makings, markings similar to the door shown to him by Tisiel. The key looked to be similar to the one to his room.</p>
          <p>This took no expert to figure out, no one had been into this library for a long time, the person who made that door must of lived in room 34 at sometime. If someone lives there now I will just have to be quick and use my wand of magic detection to see if there is anything there. Making his way to the room on the 3rd floor he pressed his ear up against it, no sound. Taking a deep breath Otto put the key into the door and turned it, click. He pushed the door open and sitting there looking back at him was Tisiel.</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Breaking into a ladies room without even knocking what kind of man are you?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Wait I can explain!"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "What you gonna tell me you found a book in the old library with strange symbols similar to the door?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yes?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ahahaha, it is my book, can't believe how quickly that worked you picked up the book with your own name on... Otto the mighty mage? really?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Hey it's not like the other mages had normal names and how did you know I would go to the old library and look though the books anyway?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Truthfully I didn't just took a chance to see if you where interested in the door or knew anything about it, thats why I showed you around, no one else has taken any real interest in it. So do you want to know whats behind the door?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Well, yeah"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Well come in, and give me my key back. There was a book in that old library with strange signs on like the door that I found weeks before your arrival, I managed to decipher some of it and it took me to one of the ruins just north of here, looked like an old part of the academy that had fell into disuse or something happened to it. Anyway hidden inside was this ring."</p>
          <p>Tisiel places a small dark grey ring down on the table, with the strange signs all over it glowing dimly red.</p>
          <p>Otto - "You did all that already? What does the ring do?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yes well, my specialty is deciphering old texts and charms"</p>
          <p>Otto - "How do you already have a specialty..."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "My parents do this sort of thing, they decipher old languages, magic texts, relics and items. Also.. I am level 12 so I already picked my element."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Don't remember reading about the decipher element but I am not going to lie that sounds cool"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "My element isn't  called decipher, whatever I will just wait till you unlock your elements. The ring it's self though. Does nothing that I can figure out."</p>
          <p>Otto - "So when you say help, do you want me to try to and find what the ring does? help you read the text?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ah the help I need is well, do you have the skill Tether? It's just I can't learn it.."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Used all your points?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel nods in response. "But I also will need help going here" She holds out a badly drawn map and points to a grave yard. "There is a chance we might be attacked so if I have you there... As long as I can outrun you they will be busy eating you while I get away. Deal?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "I'll learn tether, and maybe some other spells to help us KILL our opponents not run away."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I mean, as long as I get to live."</p>
          <p>Otto - "When are we going?"</p>
          <p>Titles - "I'll meet you out front in 5."</p>
          <p>Otto - "... Yeah alright."</p>

          <p>Later out in front of the cliffside.</p>
          <p class="stats">

            <li>Charisma: 2</li>
          </p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Whats that face?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Can't put any more points into magic. Why?</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "You can't put more points in then the level you are, points for items and your titles go on top of that."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I see, then, I am not sure what other stats to get."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah, fighters have it easier, strength and either vitality or dexterity. For me I picked Magic and Sense, since I want to be an explorer."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Makes sense, I should pick vitality, endurance, willpower, dexterity maybe charisma...."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "You are just naming all of them."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Urgh I can't decide!"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Lets just go, you can pick on the way."</p>
          <p>Walking up north of the cliffs away from the academy the path soon becomes more dirt then stone, unused in so long. About 40 minutes later they arrive at the ruins of what could of been a small campus, it was hard to tell what it was with only the foundations of the buildings surviving.</p>
          <p>Otto - "This where you found the ring?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah, the grave yard was built outside of town though, I would of gone alone but, well you will see."</p>

          <p>Arriving before the grave yard the pair stare blankly forward. 10 meter black metal spikes raised from the ground placed close to each other too small for a person to pass though, with an eerie ghost like gas passing between the spikes.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Take it there is no gate?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Nope. This erm, wall is the problem I have."</p>
          <p>Otto - "And how will tether solve your problems?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Well, according to this book the ring has to be placed on that erm alter? inside the grave yard to prove you belong to the society."</p>
          <p>Otto - "The alter is half a meter behind the bars, surely you can just place it on with your hand"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I mean, if you want to put your hand into and though that gas, I won't stop you."</p>
          <p>Otto - "... It's corrosive isn't  it?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Very." Tisiel kicks a rock into the gas and it disappears before it can reach the other side.</p>
          <p>Otto - "Amazing, and the ring won't dissolve?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "If it does, it is the end of this mystery, but it shouldn't".</p>

          <p>With a shake of his head Otto picks up the ring from Tisiel's hand and places it on his own. He then pushed his mana though the tip of his finger and it came out like a rope. He attached the ring to the end of the rope like tether, it stuck when he willed it to grab the ring. Pushing the tethered ring into the gas he was surprised when nothing happened, pushing it past the bars and out and placing it on the alter.</p>

          <p>Looking at each other, the bars shoot into the ground in an instant and the gas dissipates. Behind is left grave stones, grass and a small stone mausoleum in the middle.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Ladies first."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Get moving you coward."</p>

          <p>Otto - "No zombies, surprising."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Don't jinx it."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Grab the ring?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "On the way out, same method or we die."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Glad I asked..."</p>

          <p>Opening the door and looking around inside, the pair see nothing, it's dark so they case mage light, mana gathers in the palm of their hands and gives off a small blue glow.</p>

          <p>Otto - "This is the light from the cliffside."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah I mean, it's a common and useful spell."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Ah"</p>
          <p>Inside was three stone boxes, the length and width of a man. On top of each of the boxes carved from stone was the sculpture of two woman and a man.</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Sarcophagus, Alden nobles are buried like this even today."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I did not know that. Our dead are buried in the village."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "We burn ours. Since you took money from a dead girl before, guess you won't mind breaking open some ones resting place?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "I don't mind, but you make me sound like a bad guy..."</p>
          <p>Tisiel just smiled as she crouched down opened the book and started reading and marking her fingers along the signs on the stone.</p>
          <p>Pushing the stone lids to one side in the first Otto found a skeleton of a woman, probably the woman who was carved on top. Prying the rings from her fingers and the necklace from her finally he took the tiara from her head. Tisiel looked up at him as he removed items from a grave with a strange look.</p>
          <p>Otto - "I remember this being your idea, you might need them"</p>
          <p>Tisiel just rolled her eyes and went back to studying the signs around the sarcophaguses. In the second was the skeleton of a man, a wand, crown and one ring. The third contained another woman, jewelry and one coin. Making small pile of loot on the ground Otto turned to Tisiel.</p>
          <p>Otto - "Learn anything?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I will have to keep coming here to read these, but the words I think I understand, he is a king, she was a queen and the second woman was his daughter."</p>
          <p>Otto - "They died at the same time?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "No real evidence of that. Let's see what you found."</p>
          <p>Tisiel looked though the items before deciding she had no idea which where important and which where not.</p>
          <p>Otto - "Look away for a moment."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Why?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Secret."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Fine, but no funny stuff."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Like I would..."</p>
          <p>Otto took out his wand and passed mana though it before placing it back, he then moved the crown, wand and the kings ring to one side. The Queens tiara & ring. The daughters coin. "You can look again"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I had to wait for you to make two piles?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "The ones in this pile contain magic, these don't"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I won't ask how but it would be amazing if they still contain magic, It must of been centuries since anyone came here. Let's get them all back I can use my skills to decipher these items and tell you what they all do."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Sure, let's put them in your bag, keep them safe."</p>

          <p>When the pair step outside the mausoleum some of the stone statues carved on the graves or around the mausoleum fell apart. One manages to maintain some of its form and runs towards Otto and Tisiel who split and run, seeing the stone figure of a warrior from an age Otto did not know was running after Tisiel.</p>

          <p>Running up to the golem Otto cast 'Strike' and the weak statue became enraged but the mana that stuck down from above him had almost tore his arm off. "Tisiel, Strike it." Tisiel turned and thew a ball of mana into it. One arm breaks off and Otto seeing manaball can be used as a weapon joins in and creates a ball of mana in the palm of his hand and slams it into the statue. Under the bombardment soon the statue fell apart with a creepy cry of anguish. </p>

          <p>Otto - "They must of all been guardians, for them to be so weak. Some of them even broke apart when activated."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "More impressive that they even activated, but that could help us determine the age of this place."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Been meaning to ask, if it has been here so long, don't you think someone else would of opened the door by now, or know what it was or what this graveyard is?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "It's possible, but the fun is in the discovery. Now get the ring with tether and let's leave before something else comes to life."</p>

          <p>Tisiel practically locked herself in her room for a few days, only coming out to go to lessons and eat. Otto went to check on here everyday, it was amazing at the speed she deciphered at considering she had to make time for her normal studies.</p>

          <!-- Class - Past level 10 -->

          <!-- Combat between mages, mages and others. -->

          <!-- Students poor in , talk etc teacher comes in , class listens -->
          <p>Teacher - "Todays lesson will be on combat between mages, and a little on combat between mages and other classes. The upcoming duels have some of you excited, and this lesson is to help you prepare for the battle ahead. Now in real duels you will be permitted to use your own equipment but for this session you can only use the weapons provided to you, and the uniform you are wearing now. You may not enchant or enhance any of the equipment."</p>

          <p><li>Body:<font color="darkgrey">  Academy Robe (black).</font> Magic: +1, Health + 10.</li></p>

          <p>"Now the most obvious thing when thinking about duels between mages is that they use magical attacks. Convention gives that should you be up against a mage Willpower is the best option to counter that as it reduces the damage by more vitality increases your health. However you must consider the bigger picture, once you leave the academy not all of your opponents will be mages and some will use physical attacks and the points you put into Willpower will do nothing to protect from that.</p>

          <p>"The second thing to think about during a duel although not as relevant during your lower levels is the amount of mana you and your opponent have. If you run out of mana it is likely you will pass out early on and be unable to fight."</p>

          <p>"Finally is the element type. You might be an amazing fire-mage but if your opponent is using water, you are at a huge disadvantage so keep that in mind. If there are no further questions about the duels we will move onto charms and how to counter them."</p>

          <p>The lesson continued as normal, reading though past mages, their feats and discoveries.</p>

          <p>Looking though the list of skills a lighting mage could learn Otto could not really decide which he wanted and which he should avoid. He narrowed it down to just a few he felt like he could use:</p>

          <p> 
            Chain Lightning,
            Dazing Bolt,
            Thunderstorm,
            Shocking Touch,
            Sparks,
            Lightning Bolt,
            Lightning Rune,
            Lightning Cloak,
            Thunderbolt,
            Static Field,
            Wall of lightning,
            Lightning Storm,
            Discharge,
            Charged Charge.
         </p>

         <p>He decided to pick up, lightning cloak, shocking touch, chain lighting, charged charge and wall of lightning.</p>

         <p>Thinking on what the teacher had said, mages in the duels would be using magic attacks so it is potent to put points into willpower. But Otto wanted to think about the future also, no not putting points into endurance but strength. There was nothing in the rules to say he had to use magic, and his element lightning would travel easier though a metal blade then a wooden wand.</p>

         <p>His hp at the moment was 210. The largest attack a level 10 student using a non elemental attack would be strike with no element would be about 100. Hoping even with the element added maybe he could take two hits. His plan would fall apart if the hit was a critical however.</p>

         <!-- level *5 magic * 8 = mp // level * 10 vit * 14.5 +100 = hp -->
         <p>Otto had made his preparations and headed to the arena where the duels would be held this week. Those not dueling would have to take notes and give feedback to those who where dueling.</p>

         <p>Otto would be dueling on days 3 and 5. He spent the first day watching his class mates duel, most of the matches ended quite quickly with the students hp being reduced in 1 to 5 hits. There was of course the odd duel where two defensive type mages met and each would exchange blows of around 5% of their total hp and mana consumption became important.</p>

         <p>Knowing his duels would not become a slogging match between two defensive mages Otto tried to concentrate on the matches between two offensive mages, or how to break though the defense of a defensive mage. What became very clear was that mages at this level where slow, not very powerful and had defences like paper.</p>

         <p>On the second day he managed to catch that some of his house mates where signed up also and went to see their matches. Tisiel's match ended in her loss, she only signed up for the experience and would never be a dedicated combat mage. Shrorlei's match was a weird one, with some of her spells not activating and her opponents sometimes fizzling out, the teachers reacted with no shock at all like it was expected but some of the students, like Otto could not understand. Reingard overwhelmed his opponent with a constant stream of manaballs but soon ran out of mana and passed out, he had won the match however. Ralsan did not fight today and Otto had missed his first match yesterday.</p>

         <p>On the third day Otto equipped his formal outfit, mages robe and headed down to the area again. This time however instead of watching the matches he made his way into the armory beneath the area. Inside where many students picking out weapons and signing in that they where present. Otto signed next to his name picked up a completely metal spear and sat down to wait. He got a few weird looks, some of the students even pitted him thinking he must of thought the metal spear was some kind of magic staff, but non of them thought to correct him.</p>

         <p>Soon enough Otto's name was called, along with another boys Daniel. He was tall, a little chubby, with hair so short you could see his scalp like it had recently been shaved off and grown back. He had a friendly face however, squinting eyes that looked like they where smiling. He had a 20cm wand in his hand made of wood, the wood was much darker then the wand Otto had in his room. Thinking there is not much to learn from his opponent and he would just stick to his plan he greeted Daniel with a smile and a bow. Daniel bowed back and the pair made their way into the area.</p>

         <p>It was hot, too hot. The moment they stepped out Otto could feel his face starting to sweat, the crowd where shouting on their friends and now being down in the middle of it all he could hear just how loud the curved walls of the area made the crowd. Otto opened with casting lightning cloak, lightning covered his entire robe but would only react on contact so it was of no threat to Daniel with that the match began. Daniel opened with a manaball which gathered in the palm of his hand and looked to be made of mud and earth, before he had much time to debate Daniel's element it was flung towards him at great speed. Casting wall of lightning in front of him, lightning bolts stuck up from the ground 1m in height. Otto ducked and the ball his the lighting bolts and broke apart, the pieces of the ball exploded out in all directions some of them hitting into Otto's arm and  side. He had lost a lot of mana and some hp in that exchange and Daniel had come out on top. Gripping his spear and casting Charged Charge his body felt lighting crawling all over his skin his muscles twitched from the stimulus and he shot forward and great speed. Daniel taken back by this sudden change summoned an earthen 1m wall in front of himself, which Otto just jumped over easily with his increased speed. He lunged the spear into Daniel's center and cast Shocking touch, the spell worked by releasing lighting-mana from his fingers but as he had hoped the lighting ran the length of the spear and entered Daniel's body. The last thing Otto remembered was the great pain in his feet and legs as a 1m earthen spike shot out of the ground and sent him flying. The match was over.</p>

         <p>Waking in a bed unfamiliar to him with bright white light shining into his eyes, Otto reached his hand to cover his face from the brightness and looked around. In a bed to the right of him sitting up eating red grapes was Daniel. Turning towards Otto and smiling.</p>

         <p>Daniel - "Congratulations on your win, I'm Daniel the first earth mage to lose to a lightning mage this year."</p>

         <p>Feeling awkward Otto responded "Sorry about that, but how is it my win if I ended up in here also?"</p>
         
         <p>Daniel - "First to bring the opponents health to 10 points wins, after you lowered my health to 10 points so the spell that activated after although lowering your health to 10 points also means I came second."</p>

         <p>Otto - "Oh I see, sorry again. Can I ask, why does our health stop at 10 points?"</p>

         <p>Daniel - "Don't be sorry your prize is to do that again, you where my final match and I don't plan on going though that pain again any time soon. You don't know? Teacher should of told you, during a duel your health stops at 10 points so no one dies. If you want to know more then that you'll have to ask professor Farald he's an expert on it."</p>

         <p>Otto - "Thank you, I think I must of missed when we were taught that. How did your first match go?"</p>

         <p>Daniel - "Easy win, guess that's why I was so confident going in. This will teach me."</p>

         <p>Otto soon left the infirmary and went back to his room to rest after being granted leave for the afternoon. The show he put on today probably caught some attention using a spear to get shocking touch's range to increase. Any mage in the know however would of noticed that shocking touch alone would never of K.O. Daniel in one hit but all he could do was hope non of the students worked out his plan. Trying to formulate a new plan Otto went top side, on the top of the cliff was an area set out for training, or at least that what it had become. Otto was trying to push his lighting-mana into the spear and throw it, the only trouble was, the lighting-mana he wrapped around the spear didn't travel with the spear, the spear flew and the lighting mana just dissipated. "There must of been a skill for this I don't have yet or missed.. I am out of spell points anyway."</p>

         <p>Ralsan - "If you have a spare spell point and force it enough you can learn a skill that way. Would look cool to see a lighting spear."</p>

         <p>Otto - "Hey, yeah it would of but I don't have any skill points left."</p>

         <p>Ralsan - "Please tell me you at least got discharge?"</p>

         <p>Otto - "No, I thought since it drains so much mana I would just pass out, so I didn't get it."</p>

         <p>Ralsan - "From what I saw you passed out anyway. I just came up to tell you its dinner, we are eating together while we give each other advice."</p>

         <p>Otto - "Ah, I'll be down shortly, thank you."</p>

<h4>The fourth day.</h4>
<!-- 樫 -->
<p>The class was split for the fourth day into elemental groups. On normal weeks this would be every fourth and fifth day so that the students could learn directly from someone who picked the same element as them. From level 50 onwards mages could pick two elements but for the most part the instructors of this class where previous graduates working under professors at the academy. The instructor for the lightning class was Edgar, a man in his 30's. While not one for combat has been studying at the academy since he was 14, at level 40 his level was quite average, most non-combat would be between level 30 and 50, while he was not a direct combat class his studies into elements and time at the academy helped him. Combat classes would range from 30 all the way up to 80! Depending on their experience.</p>

<p>"Today we will be looking at the different types of lightning, as some of have seen different mages have different color lightning. This is the easiest way to distinguish between types. The basic colours are Yellow, Orange, Purple and White in that order. There are other colours as I am sure you are aware and they will fall somewhere along this scale. For example pink & green color represents the inclusion of moisture, snow or dust. So some common green lighting is those who have earth or water or nature elements in high concentration inside of their mana."</p>

<p>"Red is quite rare also as it's a mix of lightning and rare fire elements. Although there are exceptions these are just a rouge guide line. What I would have you do this lesson is learn from each others and my own lightning colours. Make notes on the color, and what kind of mana concentrate the lighting is made of. Finally make note of what effects this produces, I expect finding yellow, orange and some other colours will be quite easy as for purple it is rare but I am told we have a student this year from the illustrious Elzach house, may I offer you congratulations you will surely become an arch-mage at least." Edgar looked to the back of the auditorium sitting at the back was a tall boy with stylish blonde hair, deep blue eyes, strong jaw and a large nose. This was Vasso of house Elzach.</p>

<p>"As for white lightning, black and platinum you will not be able to see them today, or perhaps ever in your life times. We will speak briefly about them at the end of the lesson but since they are so rare it is not something you will need to consider."</p>

<p>The class soon erupted into an organization frenzy as students took notes on each others lightning. From a light gold, deep red, sea blue, snot green and of course ultra-violet purple (紫气东来). Although it was a bright purple it seemed almost misty, like something was hidden, as if you could push the mist and away and the color below would be even more shocking.</p>

<p>The most common colours where blue, yellow, green and red. There where more colours like orange, brown, gold, silver. This simple list alone does not really describe the rainbow like array of colours, with shades, mixes and different combinations of patterns. While there was one student silver there was two with gold lightning, they where twins. Otto's lightning was a deep blue that got lighter towards the edges.</p>

<p>Soon the students realised that although the original list of basic colours contained four, the level between them was not a small gap, nor was the the color not being apart of the list an indication that it was weak. It was just that yellow, orange and purple contained very few elements or impurities, these referer to the purest forms of lightning not the most powerful or useful.</p>

<p>One student named Oliver had seaweed green lighting, his dad wish a fisher from Jamlesnur and his mother was the towns light mage. His mother had the fire element and his farther water, his lightning color seem to come from the sea green, with a weak fire elements and his own lightning. There was a little proof any of it was passed on, usually the place you trained in or what you took inspiration from had a more pronounced effect, but in this case it was clear his parents had effected the make up of his mana.</p>

<p>As the lesson was coming to an end Edgar brought the class back together for one final lecture. "Since Vasso is here I won't spend too long explaining the purple and white lightning in great detail, no doubt you will find out enough over your next 2 years here. As you might of noticed the list I gave you at the start contains only four of the many colours. These are the primary colours for lightning and are in order of raw power not usefulness or efficiency, as you might of noticed some of your lightning gives a higher damage output then others with even the same colour or maybe a lower mana cost. The primary colours are the lightning we know of with only one type of element of mana inside. As for the colour purple is the closest known to heavenly lightning that human can use, white is heavenly lightning but no human has ever been recorded using it we only know if it by observing the natural world. Lastly for those who asked about black lightning it is known as hell lightning and was only recorded in ancient tombs and old records before our time."</p>

<p>"Don't forget you have more rounds of combat tomorrow, Class dismissed."</p>

<p>As the class ended the majority of the students crowded around Vasso to ask about his house, lightning, or just to win favour for those who knew what being apart of house Elzach meant. Otto made his way out of the class without anyone paying him any attention, his lightning was blue and although it was unlike the other blues in the class it was likely because he was from a different place, and there where many blues. The first thing he did was make his way back to the cliffside.</p>

<p>On his way back he stopped when the road had turned from stone to dirt beneath his feet. There had been wooden lanterns with paper screens erected from the path deep into the woods, it was not dark yet but there was a dim glow been given off in each of the lanterns, they where spaced evenly either side of the path.</p>

<p>Otto POV</p>

<p>"Well it is only afternoon I have time to spare..." I said to myself. Walking down the path I soon heard sounds of people sparing, nothing unusual considering first years are undergoing combat classes right now. The path split into new paths, the main route being lined with wooden lanterns standing from the ground, the side paths being lined with paper lanterns hanging from trees. Taking a peek down each path led to small groups of 1 ~ 3 floor houses with students near by sparing. Soon the main path broke open to a market area, food stalls, potions, scrolls, everyday items and consumable equipment. None of the other student areas had a small market place, the cliff side never would be even the manors that could be found to the east high up did not have a market near them, every student and even staff would make their way into the academy proper to buy magical items, consumables or even to visit good restaurants.</p>

<p>The signs where all unreadable, the writing looked like shapes of things at times and others looked like letters from a place very far away. Ignoring that I took a stroll around the market place. It was quite noisy considering it's small size and even though we were all students at the academy (or entourage of a well of family) I felt like I stuck out.</p>

<p>One old man shouted out to me as I passed another wooden hut. "If you have come to try Lakian food, ramen is the best place to start, come on in." I am hungry I didn't eat during class, so I took him up on his offer and nodded and sat on one of the tall stools by the bar. "Is there a menu?" I asked. "Don't worry about that, I'll just make you one, I don't know the Alden words for them anyway."</p>

<p>Later he placed a bowel of pork meat, noodles and some ingredients I also did not know the names of in front of me. It was delicious, I would have to come back to this little market again, but I had to ask. "So why is there a little market out here?"</p>

<p>"Ah that, Lakia has it's own customs, food and culture. It's not that we did not come to not try the Alden food and culture just sometimes you want a little taste of home you know? Not all of us came here to go to school, some like me where brought here as retainers."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll have to stop by more often, I might not be in Lakia but if I can eat more food like this, that is not an opportunity I am willing to turn down." I laughed and went to head off back to the cliff side.</p>

<p>Back at the cliffside in the shared living area Tisiel. "Hey, you finally taking a break from deciphering?"</p>

<p>"Ah yeah, combat is not really my thing but today's classes I had to go."</p>

<p>"What's your element? I never asked."</p>

<p>"Death." She giggled, "Don't worry I cannot cause death with it, it is more like I manipulate the energy of the dead. Think zombies and skeletons."</p>

<p>"So you can take the undead with you in a match!?"</p>

<p>"Aha, no this early on I cannot do anything like controlling a full undead, so I can only use basic mage spells..."</p>

<p>"Ah...So you match...?"</p>

<p>"Against another with similar handicap. I still lost, I am not really one for combat. However I am making progress in deciphering, the wand and this ring are the key to opening the door some how."</p>

<p>"Well glad to know you are making progress but you should sleep some times... I am going to bed now... are you waiting for someone?"</p>

<p>"What.. no? Just got bored of my room is all ..."</p>

<p>With that I took my leave and went to bed.</p>

<h4>The fifth day.</h4>
<p>Otto again entered the armory and debated on which weapon to pick, this time the other students in the armory where curious about what he would do. Trying to ignore their stares by telling himself this is just 5 minutes of fame they will all forget about me soon enough. Otto picked up a warhammer, the thing was easily 30kg, no mage in the right mind would use such a weapon, no normal mage could even wield such a thing. Smiling to himself internally with and idea of how to act in this battle Otto took his place and waited.</p>

<p>"Otto & Kaja make your way to the arena."</p>

<p>Kaja was a little shorter then Otto, dark blonde hair and dark blue eyes, but the most noticeable thing about her was a large wooden shield in her left hand.</p>

<p>Otto - "How did you know you would be fighting me?"</p>

<p>Kaja - "I didn't just figured some other punk would try it, if I don't need it I can drop it if I do need I got it. Although that is not a spear." she pointed to the warhammer balanced on Otto's shoulder.</p>

<p>Otto - "No, no it is not" he replied with a smile.</p>

<p>They made their way into the arena, bowed to each other and the match started. Kaja kept her wand hidden behind the shield and when she casted fireballs she moved the shield and released them at Otto who was trying his best to avoid them entirely. Taunting him as he danced. "You'll have to fight back pretty boy or I'll burn your hair off."</p>

<p>"Stop shotting me and I might" Otto relied moving aside of yet another fireball, while he was saving mana his stamina would not last much longer he would start to become slow. Using Charged charge Otto dashed across the field and slammed his warhammer into Kaja's shield, although it helped she struggled under the force and fell down. The shield had reduced the attack from 72% of her hp to just damaging 34%, it would take 3 attacks to take her down instead of 2. While down but not out, Kaja shot a fireball into Otto's stomach. -25% health. Good thing she keeps using fireball and nothing else, Otto moved to swing his warhammer again, this time without charged charge he resorted to using shocking touch but he only managed 28% of her health. Kaja struck back with a flamethrower spell putting Otto's clothes on fire, dropping and rolling away Otto lost his warhammer on the ground to put out the fire, -25% again.</p>

<p>Kaja - "What will you do now, without your toy? Time to become ash and smoke." Kaja raised her wand and the ground started to burn, Otto's feet started to sweat, she was going to set him on fire from below this time. Too far away to hit her with anything useful all my spells only have 1m range. Chain-lightning. Otto stuck the warhammer with chain-lightning, the lightning hit the warhammer and bounced into Kaja -14%, the sudden shock and pain caused her to lose concentration and Otto took his chance and dashed for her.</p>

<p>Grabbing the warhammer he felt a sudden burning sessions in his side, -28%. She hit me with another one of those damned fireballs. Screaming as he turned to use charged charge he accelerated, Kaja seeing this coming enveloped herself in fire-mana as he slammed his warhammer down into her shield, the fire mana had increased her defences 22% damage. Thinking to himself if she was level 14 or less she would be dead. -35%. The fire cloak had stuck him as he came into melee rang, His health had reached the final 10 first, his blow had landed moments after leaving her with 2% hp. He had lost.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the battle, she must of been at least level 15, would of put her hp at 250 unless she put any points into vitality in which case she might be a lower level. Unable to do anything about it now the reflection was a form of self improvement rather then an excuse for his loss, he would reflect on what happened, what he should of done and grow from this.</p>

<p>Bowing to Kaja, and her to him they left the arena and returned their weapons, it was nice to not have been knocked out this time. walking back to watch the rest of the duels though the day he got an unexpected visit from his teacher.</p>

<p>Lubin - "Rather interesting approach, Strength in a match between mages."</p>

<p>Otto - "Did not think that would slip by you, do you disapprove?"</p>

<p>Lubin - "No not really, I trust you have read though the histories at least once? You are not the first mage to try strength and magic. I'm sure you won't be the last but it is very uncommon during peace times."</p>

<p>Otto - "Why is it uncommon during times of peace?"</p>

<p>Lubin - "The method of strength and magic is one usually only taken after level 50, to do it so early would only happen when you have many types of enemies, a hard road before level 50 mind you. I just came to give some advice, Histories: Battle-mages, Fighter-Mage, Inquisitor, Mage-Tanks are all a good place to start. There are more however, slightly more unusual methods, in the main library there is also records from a necromancer and a Deathknight. Not usually given out to first year students, but usual first year students don't put points into strength."</p>

<p>Otto - "Thank you sir, but why would you go out of your way to do all this forme?"</p>

<p>Lubin - "Nothing personal, it's just my job, guide students to a path that they want to take, once they find their path help them traverse it. Don't mistake this for me picking favorites I am just doing what is expected of me. You may take your leave for the day if you want, I believe you have some reading to do."</p>

<p>Otto - "Yes sir, thank you sir" And with that Otto went to the library while the other first year students where in the arena to read up on the necromancer and the deathknight. </p>


          <!-- Tisiel's door -->

          <p>Having gotten Tisiel's letter Otto was standing in front of the giant circular door waiting for her. Tisiel soon arrived looking like she had stayed up all night again.</p>
          <p>Otto - "So you made a big break though?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yes, I am sure we can open this door"</p>
          <p>Otto - "How?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "You just have to take this ring, get down on one knee and ask me to marry you. Simple right?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "The door shall forever remain a mystery, no one will ever know what was behind it. Shame really."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - puffing out her cheeks "It was just a joke, but seriously though we can open the door, we just have to read this passage together out loud and combine the wand with the ring."</p>
          <p>Otto  - "Alright let's get this over with, these better not be wedding vows."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "It was a joke.."</p>

          <p>Together the pair read off a translated version of the passage from the book, the sounds don't fit quite together as they should but still the doors symbols glow red like the ring. As instructed Otto places the wand though the ring Tisiel is holding and they both pass mana though, sure enough the circles began to rotate. Soon the door seem to disappear like it was never there, confused the pair just look at each other.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Hold up, I had to put my wand in your ring? I bet this is a sex dungeon after all."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ohh, how about a wager. If its a sex dungeon I will buy you dinner. If not, you buy you dinner."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Aha you are on, now get your ass in the creepy sex dungeon."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Good thing no one else is around.."</p>

          <p>Stepping inside they find stairs leading down into darkness, lighting up mana balls to float around them they make their way down to the bottom. At the bottom was a small dark room, it contained a desk book shelves and a chest of draws. There were lots of books, a large blue orb giving off a little light and skulls. Many, many skulls, they lined the book shelves with books leaning against them, they where a few on the desk, the draws in the chess where full of skulls.</p>

          <div class="pop">Room<img class="popOut" src="./images/wizroom.jpg" height="400px" alt="Room"></div>

          <p>Otto - "You owe me dinner."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - ".. This is NOT a sex dungeon!"</p>
          <p>Otto - "I dunno, mood lighting, sexy skulls"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Phahaha, you freak. Get looking for loot."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yeah alright"</p>

          <p>While Tisiel was looking though the books Otto whipped out his wand and looked for magic items. Most of the objects in the room remained as they where, except from the orb the only items in the room which glowed where the quill left on the table, a wizards hat screwed up in a corner, a pendent on top of the chess of draws and one of the skulls on the book shelf. Taking these items and placing them on the desk together when Tisiel had finished looking though the books and taking the ones she likes in a small pile on the desk they decided to go though what they had found.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Think you can work out what these items do?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Well yeah, given time I am sure I can do a few of them, lets take these things out of here and back to my room we can go over what we have."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yeah I don't want to spend too long down here."</p>

          <p>Otto - "lets go over what we have, and how do we split it up?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ah, this is where I betray you, and steal all the loot for myself. Using the ill gotten goods I get propelled forward and become a huge master of the realm"</p>
          <p>Otto - "What are the chances that any of this stuff is even useful to you? And like you'd betray me, you'd have no one to join you in your sex dungeon then."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "IT IS NOT A SEX DUNGEON! .... I am not sure what it is yet, looked like a study, private place to work, but why? I am sure I will get to the bottom of though though my studies. Anyway at this level it's less about finding something but building myself around what we have found."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I am sure you will find out what was going on down there and drag me back in soon, honestly if you really wanted the items I would rather have a trust worthy partner then one or two magic items I am not sure I can even use."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ohh, you trust me? That's new. I'll tell you what they do, well what I know then we take turns taking one each?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Mmm that's more then fair, honestly the exams coming up and arena matches I am sure I will need someone to watch my back."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ahhh stop talking you're making things awkward."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Starting with the wand and ring that opened the door. I am unsure what else they can do but they seem to be symbols of the people that made the door, graveyard and lived in the ruined academy. I'd like to keep studying them..."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Taking two already? It's fine, we might need them in the future I won't give you a hard time you can keep them without it counting as one of yours."</p>
          <p>Tisiel nod's and continues - "Now the Kings crown. It's the Crown of the Dammed. A rare piece, increases your magic and decreases your charisma, as well as increasing the number of undead you can control."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Creepy."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yes well, perfect for a necromancer or a mage who just does not care for their appearance and others."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Ah, so it's perfect for you?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Tsst, I actually do want it, it is interesting but I do care how I look thank you very much."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Mmm sorry that was too far, I think you and Reingard will make a beautiful couple."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I.. What? Why do you say that!?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Knew it. Now keep going before he gets the wrong idea about why I keep coming into your room alone with you."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Tsst, you. The kings ring, is an basic undead control ring increasing your control over the undead."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yours."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Thank you. The queens tiara, it's called Queen's pawn, it comes with the skill animate stone. That explains the things that attacked us in the grave yard."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Her ring, it gives a little strength to the wearer."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Finally the daughters coin, who though more research I am not sure is there daughter at all. I am not even sure if they are related and this coin is a mystery to me, can't find any references to coins like it, and I cannot tell what kind of magic it contains."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Hmmm kind of junky items then? The tiara sounds expensive maybe it would be better to sell it?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah I don't feel like you are wrong, its so niche. It's not like we have a stone mason to make use humanoid statue's. Anyway the stuff from the room. The pendent increase your magic much more then normal items but reduces your strength it's really popular among mages if you take it with the queens ring there will be no negative effects, can't have you been to small."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Aha, I'll take them even if you are trying to get rid of that ring."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Hehe you saw though that. Next is the skull-"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yours."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "It might be amazing."</p>
          <p>Otto - "... No one is going to talk to me if I walk around with a skull."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Why do you care if people talk to you?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Do you want the skull or not?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Fine, I wanted it anyway. Now the Hat increases your magic. It's actually pretty good."</p>
          <p>Otto - "And the quill?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Come on you don't want the quill."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yeah, I want the hat but what does the quill do."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ah, it helps your chances when etching enchantments on items"</p>
          <p>Otto - "I get the feeling you came out of this better then me"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "There is still the coin and tiara."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I'll take the coin, you can sell the tiara and buy me dinner, I'm sure I was right about that sex dungeon."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I will stab you to death with this quill if you mention that again."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Hehe, fine let's go eat. I would like to know what was going on down there though."</p>

          
          <h4>Dinner</h4>

          <p>Otto - "Tisiel it had slipped my mind, but I took notes on the history of these two mages from the main library, I think you might find them more useful then me reflecting on whats happened."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "On whats happened?" Looking at the titles and quickly skimming the contents of the book. "You know, you might be right, this looks exactly like the kind of inspiration I need for myself, mind if I copy this?"</p>

          <p>Otto - "Go ahead, but don't summon skeletons and leave them in my room."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Ah that was my whole plan!"</p>

          <h3>Missions</h3>
          <h4>Sign up</h4>
          <p>It was finally mission day, after so long of waiting first years where finally in a position to leave the safety of the academy and go into the world, both inside of the academy grounds which seem vast with many areas totally unexplored and the world beyond the portal. It was also a good way to make money.</p>

          <p>The missions where not the adventure thill ride Otto had expected, one of the mission slips said "Lightning mage wanted: To put manaballs around bathhouse to keep mosquitoes away." He had ended up taking this one, he had no idea what mosquitoes where but at least he would be helping someone. Tisiel's mission of going though old junk and decrypting them seemed to suit her, Reingard had even joined her as a bodyguard. Otto left though the portal back to Banderdam, this mission would take him though Chihal and down to Savigal a port town on the border with Huonhia. Since his ID now had him marked as a combat mage he was able to join a merchant group heading to Chihal.</p>

          <p>Sitting in the back of a wagon the trip was mostly uneventful, Chihal sat between 3 ports so naturally had a large market place. There were no walls, no castle and seemed very peaceful, it was far from any border conflict with the monsters down south even if Huonhia ever tried to invade it was unlikely they would push this far to assault Chihal it could not serve any strategic importance. The town it's self was rather small, there were few farms outside tended by mages who had retired from the academy and inside the town was a few dwellings, tavern, inn and the market place. It took 9 hours to arrive they had stopped for lunch but the time was still very good. It would take a further 6 hours at least to reach Savigal so Otto decided to book a room at the inn then have a look around the market place.</p>

          <!-- Inn -->

          <!-- Market place with strange goods. -->
          <p>The market place was selling all kind of oddities with merchants traveling between ports and cities stopping off here they opened shop from their wagons, wands, weapons, armor, skeletons, mana stone, mounts, there was even one merchant selling long metal tubes with a wooden handle, he claimed they where wands of explosion magic but said he had no idea how they worked.</p>
          <!-- journey -->
          <p>Setting off from Chihal the weather was colder then it was yesterday. Without the wagon to sit in today would leave him tired. Wrapping the robe around himself to keep the wind off he walked along the path with the rainforest on either side. There were a few others traveling also but most of the merchants and others where heading to Banderdam or the two larger ports in the area. Savigal would be a small port it seems. After walking for 3 hours Otto needed to pee, walking into the rainforest just off the path to do it in peace.</p>
          <!-- The dead foreigner -->
          <p>While reliving himself he soon noticed hanging above him from the tree was a deadman. Pulling his robe back around himself and grabbing his warhammer Otto span around looking about. Nothing. Closer inspection would show he had been dead awhile, his flesh was mostly gone, the eyes removed it seemed the animals had long been at his body, the smell was bad but thats not what had Otto's attention. Tangled in the vines the man was wearing strange clothes, even strange for a nobel, a blue jacket with gold trim, but it had no hood and didn't feel like a woolen robe. The cuffs and shoulders where not sewn into the sleeves but rather left to hand over the top. The mans face was strange too, but hard to judge a man who's been picked at by the birds. Looking down on the ground some of the mans belongings where here, strange purple coins, a wand, looked like the merchants explosion wands back in Chihal, if it was though it was faulty as no explosion had happened around here. There where papers and food. Otto decided to move the items into his bag as the mans bag was torn.</p>

          <p>"I'll take them back to the academy with me maybe Tisiel can make sense of these things." setting back on the path to Savigal Otto made his way for another hour before coming across another body, a merchant he had seen earlier that day. This body was fresh, still bleeding out but long dead. He was not a well to do merchant, he had no wagon or body guards but was traveling with others. Seems they had no robbed him as his trinkets and food lay scattered about the path and into the forest.</p>
        <!-- Danger -->

        <p>Getting closer to the body Otto could see the dead body of a large wolf in the direction the blood went into the forest, the wolf was almost 2 meters tall when stood on all fours and over 3 meters long. The problem was there was only one wolf body, even Otto knew wolves don't attack alone normally. The other merchants where no where to be seen, perhaps the pack is still chasing them? They might double back for the kill they got, I should get away from here.</p>

        <p>I left at a brisk pace down the road, since the merchants didn't come back towards me I must assume they made their way down here so I should keep a look out. Soon enough I came across the other merchants, arranged around the wagon with small gaps in their line. Unable to see into the forest the only monsters I could make out where two large wolves similar size to the one back with the dead merchant and one smaller about half their size closest to my position. Unsure of what to do for awhile I just stayed still, soon enough a large man in the group shouted towards me. "If you stand alone they will target you and take you out, run quick and get into the group." at his shout I ran, I ran as fast as I could, not having invested many points into dexterity it was not easy as I used the strength I had invested into my stats to pump my legs as hard as I could. Soon enough the wolves noticed me, the small one charged towards me as the merchant's and body guards intercepted the larger wolves taking this opportunity to attack them. Seeing the wolf run towards me with its fangs out scared me. I gripped tight around the warhammer and launched myself with Charged Charge, my legs twitched with lighting, my speed shot up over that 1 meter gap. Launching myself warhammer first into the beast it hit the ground with a whimper, blood and fangs splattered over the floor. The hammer has caused more damage then the lighting. A normal baby wolf would of had it's whole head caved in, my attack did 72%. The large man who had called me over stabbed a spear into the wolf as it tried to get back up. It would never get back up.</p>
        
        <p>He ran to help with the two larger wolves, I tried to strike one of them with a lightning strike, 0.05% damage. One of the larger wolves was slayed the other ran bleeding back into the forest. I was later told by Giselher the large body guard who speared the smaller wolf that the large wolves where between level 20 and 29. They had high magic defences and often made pray of magical or weak humans. I don't know what the large wolf dropped by the small wolf dropped a pair of gloves, Giselher gave them to me saying I did most of the damage anyway and he was surprised a mage would have so much strength. I gladly accepted it would be my first monster drop. To get to Savigal I decided to join their group just encase the last wolf made a return.</p>

        <li>Hands:<font color="darkgrey">Mutt's Mitt's</font> Willpower +1.</li>

        <h4>Savigal</h4>
        <p>Savigal port was so small it did not even have a market worth a mention, just ships and merchants setting up on wooden crates or out the back of the wagons, no real stalls. The port had 2 ships in dock, a small cog with one sail. The other was a Hatalia ship, a balinger with a single mast with many holes for oars although they where closed right now, I could only tell it was from Hatalia because of the flag flown from the rear of the ship, it was unlikely they built the ship themselves, Hatalia's navy might be as large as Aldens but they where a much larger country. Hatalian's brought their ships from Chalbia.</p>

        <p>I made my way though the small market place buying fruits and rations for the trip back, I could make the trip in 2 days and rest at a town each night so I did not need much, but when traveling and with the funds to do so it' nice to try new things. After shopping I went to the office building, normally a small town like this would use the village hall for any government administration, but since Savigal was a port town capable of being used during times of war it had a government office building here. All I had to do was take my ID and mission slip in and in return they informed the bathhouse. While I waited for the sun go to down since the mission was to take place just after the sun sets I rested in the rather large tavern.</p>

        <h4>The bath houses</h4>
          <p>Just after the sun set I made my way to the bath house, waiting for me was an elderly woman, haunched over a small cane in her hand she smiled and waved towards me. I waved back, my robe must of given me away.</p>

          <p>"Must be the boy they sent from the academy, first year am I right?"</p>

          <p>"Yes but how did you know?"</p>

          <p>"You robe, pure black. They will give you a new one when you get back, thing is it embarrasses the academy if a mage with colours dies on their first mission."</p>

          <p>"Oh I see.."</p>

          <p>"Don't worry the only danger to your mission is making it all the way out here, the task of putting up mana-balls should be simple really. Follow me I just need you to put lightning-mana balls inside these stone totems. Should keep those damned things away. What you doing back there don't be shy the bathhouse is empty tonight."</p>

          <p>"Ah yes sorry, the sign said ladies so.."</p>

          <p>"It's empty get in here."</p>

          <p>"Yes Ma`am."</p>

          <p>The mission was really short, after putting a few lighting mana balls and chatting to the bathhouse lady for awhile I found out the mana-balls had gone out because the mana stones keeping them active had run out. I also learned mosquitoes are small bugs that bite you, and it is really itchy! The cure however is a 40 degree bath ... This has to be the best perk of the job.</p>

          <p>While relaxing in the bath, I could feel the warmth move into my toes, it felt like the warmth was moving into my bones, my muscles relaxed and time just seem to pass by...</p>

          <p>"AHHHHHHHHH"</p>

          <p>"Huh?" I jumped up and grabbed for my warhammer, the cold soon gripped by body after leaving the warm waters. As I looked towards the scream I noticed it was a girl wrapped in a towel, soon her mother came to her and I remembered I was naked.</p>

          <p>"Ah you're still in here? I didn't think you'd still be in here oh deary me put a towel around yourself gave the girl a fight" the bathhouse woman seemed to be enjoying the mischief she had made. Is she so bored as to set me up like this!?</p>

          <p>After apologizing to the girl and her mother and the many other women on the way out I made my way over to the tavern. Tonight I would drown that embarrassment in drink.</p>
          
        <h4>side quest</h4>
        <p>Just as I was getting my first drink the bar tender handed me a note, on the front was my name in scribbled hand writing. Inside was a badly drawn map with a line from the tavern into the nearby forest with a large X on it. "What the hell is this?" I asked no one in particular.</p>

        <p>"Can't say I understand it, but looked like a map to me."</p>

        <p>"Mmm yeah thanks, who gave it to you?"</p>

        <p>"Bathhouse.."</p>

        <p>"Yeah I'm not going."</p>

        <p>"Isn't she your employer?"</p>

        <p>"...It's almost like you don't want my money.. Fine I'm going.."</p>

        <p>"Take care of yourself, no doubt she's up to no good."</p>

        <p>"...Yeah"</p>

        <p>Making my way back into the village, past the bathhouse and up into the forest, not too far into the forest was a small house, walking up the stairs and knocking on the small door I wanted, soon enough the bathhouse women opened the door. "Ah good you got my message"</p>

        <p>"Barely it looked like a child's drawing."</p>

        <p>"Well it is, Mia here drew it."</p>

        <p>It was the girl from the bathhouse, I could not be more embarrassed. "Ah sorry about earlier." I touched the back of my head and tried to smile. Mia just looked away with a red face, seems she dose not like me. I wouldn't like me either..</p>

        <p>"So, why did you call me out here?"</p>

        <p>"Ah well I know it's not part of the request I sent to the academy, but would you light a manaball here also? Just to help out an old women, no one wants to be bitten by those nasty thing."</p>

        <p>"Yeah alright." I lit up the stone totem from the inside.</p>

        <p>"Mia is my granddaughter. Not that you asked, but she is a Mage and is going to the academy next year."</p>

        <p>"I'm sure she will enjoy it there and learn much, just write ahead in advance and ask not to be put into the cliffside."</p>

        <p>"Well of course everyone knows that."</p>

        <p>My eyebrow twitched at the comment..</p>

        <p>"What I really was hoping was that you could talk to Mia and tell her about the academy it's been so long since I went I am sure it is nothing like it was before."</p>

        <p>"Ah okay, I guess I can, as a way to say sorry..."</p>

        <p>"That's the spirit, I'll get you two some drinks and food, I hope you like mangos."</p>

        <p>This is going to be so awkward. In the end Mia was easy to talk to, since we were almost the same age and I had only just joined the academy and she was so interested in it we had a lot to talk about. I ended up sleeping there after Mia went home, at least I saved the cost of a room, I would head back early in the morning and try to make it to Chihal and look around the market by the afternoon.</p>
        
        <p>I ended up having to give Mia my address so she could send me mail if she had more questions about the academy, when they found out I was staying in the cliffside they pitied me a bit, but if I'm honest since day one I have enjoyed staying there. I waved good bye and set off along the path to Tisiel.</p>

        <p>On the journey back I saw more guards then usual, maybe because of yesterdays attack. I managed to make it back to the market by just after midday I really made good timing. In the market I managed to find a book with strange markings on it, the same strange markings I saw with Tisiel on the door in the cliffside. I knew I had to buy it, the merchant only had odd and unique items which all seem to be of little or no use other then being odd. In the end I had managed to buy the book in exchange some of the coins I had found on the foreigner, he seemed much more interested in those then real money.</p>

        <p>Staying the night again, and heading to Banderdam in the morning was my plan. After I was finished at the market however I was approached by Giselher who was escorting a merchant group asking if I would travel with them to Banderdam tonight. While it was risky to travel at night, I would be with the other guards and make some more money. I took them up on the offer.</p>

        <p>That night I walked next to the wagon along with Giselher, he told he had been working as a guard for hire for over 10 years since he left the military academy. Since the attack yesterday the merchants would be hiring more but the chance of attack was less, usually when one strong monster is taken down in an area it takes awhile before another appears. As if to prove him wrong only 15 minutes after he said it we came across some monsters.</p>

        <p>Skeletons. This better not be Tisiel's doing was all I could think. The battle was not to my advantage initially, skeletons had a slight natural resistance for lightning. I soon found however they where very weak to my warhammer, I soon gave up on using spells on the skeletons directly and opted to save my mana to charge, and shock them to create an opening.</p>

        <p>55% damage per swing, swing, shock, swing. Repeating this over and over until we had killed 50 skeletons between us. "What level are they Giselher?"</p>

        <p>"Around level 10, skeletons are quite common here with the jungle to the south and academy to the north. These are mage skeletons they came from the north and they are really weak. It's their numbers that will take you down."</p>

        <p>"Anything good drop?"</p>

        <p>"Nah skeletons at level 10, you'll get a few bones.. if you are into that kind of thing."</p>

        <p>"Well, I have a friend who might be interested..."</p>

        <p>"Forgot you are from the academy for a moment, take them they are worthless really and I feel wrong being around them."</p>

        <p>"Ah yes thank you, honestly I can't say I want to hold onto them for too long."</p>

        
        <!-- Town - Talk to Leon and his sister, who gives Otto the mask he found in the forest. -->
        <p>After we made it to Banderdam I thanked Giselher, got paid and headed to the shop Leon worked at. Just as he said he was now an apprentice shop keeper, he was behind a counter thinking about something hard while looking down at some papers and a large book. I walked up to him and knocked on the desk "Shouldn't the shop keeper greet the costumers?"</p>

        <p>"I am so sorry si...Hey you came!" Leon wore a bright smile but the frown lines still remained on his forehead, whatever was troubling him had not left his mind.</p>

        <p>"You working hard? You seem a little stressed."</p>

        <p>"Ahaha no no, just learning to keep the books all this maths hurts my brain. I am enjoying it really its a good challenge. So they finally let you out of the academy? Why don't you stay for dinner? My sister is a really good cook!"</p>

        <p>"I'll take you up on that, but I'll buy the ingredients I just got paid and you have work to do. I'll come back with supplies and you can show me the way to your house."</p>

        <p>"Ah really? That sounds like a plan!"</p>

        <p>As agreed I went shopping for fresh vegetables and meat, I did just get paid and if I took any money back to the academy with me they would take it as I owed them a debt. It's not like I could spend all of the money though, they sent me on a mission and knew how much I would be paid for that at least. Arriving back at the shop I had left a over an hour ago Leon was still inside, it seemed that clocking off even at after sundown was a favour to the shop keeper he owed. We walked and talked as we made our way to Leon's place, while it was inside the walls of Banderdam it was not near the market but across the other side of town in what appeared to be where the working class of the city lived. The houses were not run down and decrypted but there where children out playing, the streets where even clean. I decided it best not ask I might come off as rude assuming it would be dirty and run down. Once we made it to a three story building and walked up to the 3rd floor, inside was Leon's sister. Mouse brown hair like her brother but longer, she was smaller and had a lot less facial hair. Her cheeks still contained a bit of baby fat it seems, but there was no doubt who was in charge.</p>

        <p>"You said you would be home late, I haven't started dinner and you bring home a stranger?"</p>

        <p>"Relax Milly this is Otto, I told you about him he saved my life coming back though the forest, he brought food and I was hoping you would be able to cook..."</p>

        <p>"And what will you two be doing while I'm cooking!?"</p>

        <p>"I err.. But he's our guest."</p>

        <p>Otto - "Nice to meet you Milly I am Otto, I'll help you cook, It's not my first time and Leon can clean up."</p>

        <p>Leon looked towards me puzzled but Milly just agreed, it seemed she had grown quickly with her parents only dieing the year before I think it was. The food was good and I managed to catch up with Leon & Milly was good company too. I told him of the academy and my mission, the strange place that was Savigal. Leon told me of the strange items customers often brought in, apparently more so now then ever.</p>

        <p>"Ah I had been meaning to thank you more for helping me get back home alive, I didn't really have anything to give at the time, but recently I traveled though the forest guiding a Huonhia traveler and came across this." Leon placed a bone white mask on my lap, it had large stag like antlers sticking out of the top but it looked to all be on piece no joins or breaks and all of it bone white, when I touched it, it felt like the bones I had received from the skeletons, but somehow harder. The mask had two eye holes and stopped just short of where your mouth would be, on the forehead was a red symbol. It was not one I knew.</p>

        <p>"Ah truth be told, I am not too sure what it does, I showed it to my master but he said to keep it it was not something he could sell, it's not a mana item he said. Apparently it is from Leika apart of their old religion."</p>

        <p>"I can't say I know anything about it either, but I know just who to ask, thank you Leon it might not be worth money but it really interests me. Thank you."</p>

        <p>Milly - "Just glad you accepted it really, that thing has been creeping me out the whole time it was here, like it was going to come to life or something."</p>

        <p>"Ahahaha she's just exaggerating if it was a cursed item the faith would of come by now."</p>

        <p>"I'm sure it's not cursed, everyone knows cursed items are rare, thank you again Leon"</p>

        <p>Soon after I headed back to the academy, it was nice to see they where doing well but I really had to get to sleep in my own bed.</p>

        <!-- Give bones, coins and weird wand to bone woman -->
        <p>Almost as if she had been waiting for me Tisiel opened the door to the cliffside before I even managed to speak the password.</p>

        <p>"Glad to see you are not dead, come in I found things on my trip."</p>

        <p>"Nice to see you survived too." Coming inside I saw Reingard who waved to me as I came in, he was sorting though some bones of some kind of animal.</p>

        <p>"Didn't take you for a necromancer Reingard."</p>

        <p>"Tisiel's bones not mine, just really hate how she leaves them all in a pile, I had to put them in some kind of order."</p>

        <p>"Ah, well. You're really gonna hate this..." I placed a bag full of bones down next to him.</p>

        <p>"Tisiel you brought back bones for me?"</p>

        <p>"Skeleton bones, level 10. They attacked us on the way back to Banderdam, I was going to ask if they where your doing."</p>

        <p>"No no, I didn't have any bones like this before so it was not me. Sounds like there is another mage at the academy going the same route as me, but they must be a second year I don't have the mana for all these."</p>

        <p>"Well there was close to 50 of them, I don't remember all too well, I am quite tired but these where the only thing they dropped before disappearing."</p>

        <p>"Oh I also got you something, hold on it's in my room I'll go get it!"</p>

        <p>"Ah take these with you, bag of strange coins with strange marks on them, thought it was more your area of expertise then mine. Also this." I reached into my bag I kept at my side and handed over the book I had brought in the market 2 days ago. Her eye's lit up. Without a word Tisiel bowed lightly and ran straight to her room.</p>

        <p>"A book? she's going to be gone for days now."</p>

        <p>"You two grew close."</p>

        <p>"Ah yeah, I mean we did share our first mission together."</p>

        <p>"I'm glad, keep her safe Reingard, and i'm sure she will keep you happy."</p>

        <p>"What's that mean?"</p>

        <p>"Here!"</p>

        <p>Before I could reply to Reingard Tisiel in some kind of inhuman speed had made it back panting and out of breath holding a pair of boots up to me.</p>

        <p>"You didn't have to run, and thank you." I picked the boots of her hands and they felt soft. The bottom felt spongy like damp moss without the wet feeling.</p>

        <p>"Ah because you have a lightning element I thought you should have absorption boots! My parents make them, they are not very popular but maybe if you become famous they will be!"</p>

        <p>"Ah thank you, what do they do?"</p>

        <p>"Ohh, they absorb a small amount of energy and release it to help you bounce! The idea was that you could move around in melee easier but the problem was the requirement is that you are a mage."</p>

        <p>"I will have to try them out in the morning, thank you Tisiel." I gave a light bow. "But I really have to sleep, sorry to be rude but it's been a long night." I left them to their studies? It matters not what they are doing and headed to my room.</p>

        <li>Gained:<font color="darkgrey"> Bouncy Boots.</font> Absorbs a small amount of energy when struck and releases it to help you bounce! .</li>

        <!-- Get invited to dinner -->
        <p>Arriving back in my room on my bed was a new robe and letter on top with my name written atop, and the image of a stag as the water mark. Putting the letter to one side I held the robe up to get a look. It was black like the pervious robe but with mustard yellow trimming around the cuffs and hem. Truly not the best color. Opening the letter, it was an invite to the student staff dinner congratulations to the first years on officially making it a part of the academy.</p>

        <p>The only thing I wanted right now was sleep. Pushing all of this onto the desk removing my old robe, traveled clothes, before I could even think to do anything else I felt as if the bed was sucking me in and off to sleep, I feel onto the bed and asleep before I could think of anything else.</p>

        <p>The next morning I donned my new robe, the color of the yellow was not any better then it had been when I was almost asleep. </p>
          
          <!-- Dinner - Staff and students -->
          <h3>Meet Tsuma as witch princess from Leikia.</h3>
          <p>Otto could not help but stop listening to the conversation, his eyes had been caught and his full attention was now directly focused the woman who had just walked though the door. Stunning smooth shoulder length straight black hair, slightly tanned smooth skin, almond shaped eyes, as she looked around the room he could not help but admire how elegant and graceful she was moving about between the guests like a fairy. She had a slim waist and a beautiful dress, it was a deep blue and fitted against her curves. If he did not stop now he was going to be caught starring.</p>

          <p>He excused himself as hastily has he could and made his way across the room to try and strike a conversation with her only to be caught by old professor Farald, I heard from young Daniel you where curious about how the duel system works. Unable to escape he had to hope he could find her later.</p>

          <p>To his luck and amazement there was a beautiful fairy-like goddess of a woman was still there, she had taken an interest in their conversation. Using this opportunity he introduced himself.</p>

          <p>"Hello, I am Otto a first year student, are you interested in this topic also?"</p>
          <p>"Ah, yes. I am very much so. I am" she paused for a moment, "you can call me Tsuma."</p>
          <p>"Nice to meet you Tsuma, your acescent are you from Leika? It's very loverly."</p>
          <p>"Yes, I came here as an exchange, I am in my second year here."</p>
          <p>"I must be off you two, if you need me for a longer discussion please leave me a message at my office, its in the research department I imagine you haven't been there before but anyone else should be able to point you in the right direction, please excuse me."</p>
          <p>"Oh no not at all professor, thank you for your knowledge." Both of the students gave a light bow as professor Farald made his way over to a group of other professors calling to him.</p>

          <p>"I believe the dinner is starting soon, would you like to join me?"</p>
          <p>"Ah that won't be possible the seats are arranged before hand."</p>
          <p>"How about a date? A short one, tonight after the dinner. I'd like to take you to a cafe and talk, I've never been to Leika so perhaps we can start there."</p>
          <p>"I..Yeah, I can do that. I'll wait for you under the autumn tree on your right as you leave though the main door."</p>
          <p>"Perfect."</p>

          <!-- Tsuma has magic cat that turns black at night, white in the day and has purple eyes. -->

          <!-- Call for dinner -->
          <p>Ding. Ding. Ding. "Please make your way into the dinning hall, name cards are at each place please find your own name card. A flag stands on each table you can match the flag to your invitation image."</p>

          <p>Inside the hall was numerous tables with flags standing proud above them. A large red and white flag with a black stag, this must be me. On the table where places for 10, no doubt I would be unable to converse with those places too far from myself. My place was to the right on the inner side of the table to the hall, not that it mattered the outer side was still 4 tables away from the nearest wall. To my right Reingard would be sat and my left Ebba.</p>

         <!-- Dinner / POV - --> 
          <h4>Cafe Date - Otto</h4>
          <p>I arrived at the cafe before the agreed time, there were lots of various cafes around, small and large selling breads, cakes and drinks of all kinds. One cafe I walked past had little figures placed on a tray on the table and on request the staff would put them into a glass where a small liquid explosion took place and the glass filled up.</p>

          <p>In the back was a large cat figure, this was another cafe where the building itself looked like a cat, it was so obvious when placed next to the other buildings I could see why Tsuma had agreed to meet outside this cafe, that way we would not get lost. I waited there for awhile watching small bird creatures breath out fire to toast bread, a lizard creature who's tail was cut off then fed a rat which caused it to grow back instantly. It never flinched or seemed to be in pain, the tail was then placed into a metal cup with some powder and whisked quickly. Soon enough multi-colored strings could be seen wrapping around each other to make what looked like fluffy ice cream with a foggy layer been given off to show just how cold it was.</p>

          <p>She came walking up the street in a black dress that stopped just past her knees, sleeves down to a triangle over the back of her hand, and a webbed pattern across the top of her chest. Something about it seems like the fashion of an Alden witch but something was a little off, no hat.</p>

          <p>"Hey, you look really beautiful, what happened to your other dress? Was I suppose to change also?"</p>

          <p>"Ah, I had to change! That dress did not suit the place I wanted to go. You look good no need to change honestly."</p>

          <p>"Thank you. So where is it you had in mind?"</p>

          <p>"Here of course!" She said pointing to the large cat shaped building.</p>

          <p>I stared at the building again, a light brown and white cat with its eyes closed in a kind of smile laying down with its tail wrapped around itself. The door was in the side of the cat. "I... Was not expecting that."</p>

          <p>"Ah, I love cats and I always wanted to try this place. You don't mind do you?"</p>

          <p>"No it's fine, let's go." I took her by the hand and headed to the door to the cat shaped cafe. I did not notice the other girl following us with her hood up over her head to cover her face.</p>

          <p>Inside the cat shaped cafe was full of cats. The cat shaped cafe was in fact a cat cafe. I don't know why I was so surprised. Maybe because the other cafes today where all so exotic to me that I did not expect a cafe just full of cats.</p>

          <p>We where sat near one of the walls with cats sleeping all over the place, every time you tried to get near one to pet it it would either not move and not care or run away at top speed. It seemed that throughout the day the cats have had enough customers come to play with them. While we sat there we drank a hot drink from the empire. It tastes of ginger, warmth and sweet flowers. I wish I knew how to make it, this would be the perfect companion at night when out traveling.</p>

          <p>A sudden flash of light appeared in the corner of my eye, "MEEEOWWWW." A black cat with bright purple eyes was on the desk as Tsuma was stoking it's head. "This is Byakko, he's my cat. I thought since non of the others want to play with us they might play with him."</p>

          <p>"Greetings to THE Otto I am Byakko." The cat spoke with an old deep voice that very much did not suit it's extremely cute face. Byakko bowed his head during his greeting and then face up to me looking me dead in the eye awaiting a response.</p>

          <p>Taken back a little, I stammered out "HE-llo I am named Otto, what do you mean by THE Otto?"</p>

          <p>"Oh his Alden is a little rusty we only speak Leikan at home.. Off you go play!" She made a shooing motion with her hands as Byakko looked a little displeased muttering to himself "My Alden is just fine I can speak over 20 languages fluently..." He jumped onto the floor landing on his front paws and walking off proudly, head in the air and tail swishing back and forth.</p>

          <p>"So erm, why Alden? I mean there are magic academy's in most of the realms, why do people from all over come to Alden? Why did you come?"</p>

          <p>"That's easy, I came to try a new culture and because I really want to learn Alden magic! I read about it when I was a child and always wanted to try the magics that can be found here. As for others, I am not sure why they come but people go to magic academy's all over."</p>

          <p>"I didn't know Alden had magic you can't learn else where. Makes sense that people travel all over if that is the case."</p>

          <p>"Oh it is not like the magic is locked in one place, it is more like the expert in that magic taught there, the resources needed are there things like that. Lakia's academy is famous for summoning, speech, illusion and demon magic. Alden is famous for witch, charms and hex magic."</p>

          <!-- <p>I step out into the warm night, the other dinner guests making their way out and across the bridges to cafes, pubs and taverns. Once outside I turned in search of an autumn tree. Below a tree with orange-red leaves was a beautiful woman in a knee length blue dress. </p> -->

          <p>pov Tisiel</p>
<!-- Weird skull talking thing - Tisiel -->
          <p>After having arrived back in my room from the dinner party I removed the grey satin dress, shoulderless hour-glass shaped to fit my waist, flowing off my hips giving me gliding wings down to my calfs if I walked too quickly. The thought of one day being able to just glide up into the sky with nothing but my foot steps made me feel like a kid again playing at magic, the reality was that using mana was much more exserting then I had imagined in my make believe worlds.</p>

          <p>Slipping into my room wear and feeling much more like my self again, with my collections of tombs, bones, nick-nacks and skulls to greet me back into what I enjoyed most, solving the mysteries they presented. Settling down into an old wooden chair by my study table, I always wrap my hands around the curved handle, old habits.</p>

          <p>"Well it's not quite as orderly as my study but I approve."</p>

          <p>Stopping and looking around the room, I had to pause and wonder if I had gone crazy, perhaps a little drunk.</p>

          <p>"Down here"</p>

          <p>I shot out of my own skin, jumping up onto the chair. "Who is here!?"</p>

          <p>"Down here, I on top of your books."</p>

          <p>".... The.. Skull!?" My eyes fixed to the skull on the books, nothing unusual about it really. It did not move, the jaw stayed in placed, no eyes appeared in the sockets. There was a small amount of magical energy given off, it seemed no different from any other magic item.</p>

          <p>"Your first time meeting a sealed spirit?"</p>

          <p>"....Yes?"</p>

          <p>"Ahaha, well you seem like a smart girl, what do you think I am?"</p>

          <p>"Did... Someone trap your spirit into this skull? Was it your skull?.."</p>

          <p>"Well you are sharp. Yes my spirit was bound to my skull as part of my peoples funeral process. It was not a common process because the materials needed are rather rare, so it is reserved for only those who could afford it. I think the results speak for themselves, I am dead but not gone from this plane."</p>

          <p>"Can you still use magic? Can you move? How long have you been dead?"</p>

          <p>"I suppose these are normal questions since it is your first time. Very well, I cannot use magic directly I would need a medium to act though or a source of mana which I am attached to. I cannot move. Hmm hard to say really, I continued as I am currently for a few civilizations before being left inside that witches study."</p>
          
          <p>"A few civilizations? Not years? Or centuries?"</p>

          <p>"Yes, I mean 5 in total if I include my own. It looks like you have found items from some of them."</p>

          <p>"This is a lot to take in.. So the study became your second tomb? What about your first?"</p>

          <p>"Oh, Don't think it has escaped me that most of the items here are taken from the tombs of the dead. Trying to raid my tomb? This is my resting place, this skull. My people did not believe that we took anything physical into the next life."</p>

          <p>"I could tell you about the location of another tomb if that is what your interest is. The civilization that took over from my own buried their dead in pyramid shaped tombs. First the person who had died, then followed by their servants, guards and what ever else they would be taking to their next life with them."</p>

          <p>Unable to resist, I spent the whole night chatting to a skull, well the person bond to the skull. Gwrtheyrn was his name but since it was a bit of a mouthful we agreed to call him Vortigern, not much better but he seemed fussy about what he would be called. I managed to copy down to a rough map of where the tomb should be.</p>

          <!-- Arena --> 
          <p>Todays lesson started with an announcement, there would be arena team matches, those who where training to be non-combat mages did not need to join. The combat mages where expected to join, it was a good time to be noticed by merchant companies, mercenary groups & most importantly dukes. The first year matches where put on between second year matches which where the main draw of the arena matches. It would still be good to stand out in front of these people if you wanted to work with them in the future.</p>

          <p>First things first he would need 3 teams mates. They must all be combat mages & first years. The first person I could think of was Reingard. He was the only other house mate I had talked to before that was a combat mage. Ralsan wanted to become a farmer, Tisiel was not made for combat, she would one day fight though skeleton warriors but no time soon. Shrorlei despite meeting her I have no had time to talk to.</p>

          <p>I decided I had to see if Reingard knew anyone else.</p>

          <p>"So, you are telling me you have an older brother in the academy, yet you still ended up in the cliffside?"</p>

          <p>"I might have an older brother, but that doesn't mean he likes me.Anyway the point is we can recruit other people at the arena."</p>

          <p>"I mean, I guess that will work if we see what role they want to be and make a team around that. Speaking of what are you good at?"</p>

          <p>"So you asked me to make a team without knowing what I was good at?"</p>

          <p>"Guarding. Just wanted to see if you thought it was something else."</p>

          <p>"No, I know my strengths, I will be the tank for the party. But what about you Otto?"</p>

          <p>"Melee damage, and some support."</p>

          <p>That same day we went to the area to pick up some new members.</p>
          
          <h4>Recruitment</h4>
          <p>The arena was the same one we went to for the duels, while the arena had be packed back then it was much lighter now, with students standing around chatting and making posters and signs to try and recruit some new members. Reingard suggested we try asking around those trying to find groups also we might find another pair that suits us.</p>

          <p>After walking around for an hour or so we came across a couple looking to add two more members to their team. Volker & Raina a couple from Alden who met in the academy. Volker was a fire mage and Raina and water mage. "Reingard."</p>

          <p>"Hmmm yes?"</p>

          <p>"What... is your element?"</p>

          <p>"....You don't know!?"</p>

          <p>"Well I mean when I saw you duel before it didn't look like you used any element."</p>

          <p>"Oh I see. It's metal. That's maybe why you didn't notice, its not as flashy aha."</p>

          <p>"Oh so back during the duel?"</p>

          <p>"Ah, metal manaballs, I use to struggle to infuse my mana with my element so there was no huge change in color. I found it much more effective to make a large wide shield rather then a small ball, easier to control and useful as a tank."</p>

          <!-- Training. -->
          <h4>Training</h4>
          <p>We too the afternoon to head into the jungles in search of monsters to hunt to hone our skills and try to work together as a team. The first monster we came across was not a monster I would forget anytime soon. The text book describes them as centaurs, with the lower body of a horse and the upper of a man, but only in appearance, the truth was always darker then it first appeared. The body on a man on top was in fact the skin of a human, sometimes whole sometimes patch work from several different bodies, their true form lay under the mess of meat and flesh. What that was would have to wait until after the battle.</p>
          <div class="pop">Centaur<img class="popOut" src="./images/centaur.jpg" height="400px" alt="centaur"></div>
          <p>Reingard struck first with balls of mana and tanked the centaurs hooves with his shield reinforced in his metal mana. Shooting into action, I charged into the monster with the skill charged charge and stuck down with strike (lightning) infused into my warhammer, I had picked up a few tricks on the way. Just like that 10% of its health disappeared.</p>

          <p>Volker summoned flames over his hands and threw a great wave of fire, washing over the monster turning the fur on his rear black, the smell of burning fur singed and hung in the air. Raina washed Reingard in water infused mana and the scratches and dirt on his skin seemed to wash away healing him for over 25% of his total health.</p>

          <p>Putting on lightning cloak I dove back into the battle, the centaur had a heavy body, large hooves and a short crude spear it swang around and tried to stab with, the trick to the centaur was to keep it from being able to charge. Reingard would block it by staying in its line of sight, I would try to heard the monster into Reingard. Since Volker was doing more damage with his fire this worked out well for us.</p>

          <p>When I saw a gap I stuck into its knee on its rear legs, the damned monster kicked me in the chest with its hooves and I went flying. I landed against the ground and slid for a bit, my lightning cloak had shocked him on impact and given Reingard the chance to provoke the monster away from me. A cool liquid flowed over me and my health started to recover from the red.</p>

          <p>Soon the monster fell and our first day of training would stop here.The monster had dropped a necklace made of teeth and an eye ball. None of us really wanted them, but we would sell them for money, centaurs cannot be found outside of the academy.</p>

          <p>Reingard - "You took quite the hit."</p>

          <p>"Yeah, I don't know how you take so many hits all day long."</p>

          <p>"High endurance, and metal element help a lot. Keep safe though your health is low for a melee fighter."</p>

          <p>"Yeah. Should I start buying more items? I feel like I must at least be close to paying off the debt I incurred."</p>

          <p>"Sounds like a plan. Ah you two where great, Volker your fire was really effective, and Rainas healing waters work better then other healers in our year, maybe better then some second years."</p>

          <p>"Ah thank you, the range of our skills is really short however, and our vitality is not much different from squishy Otto's here."</p>

          <p>"What a nick name..."</p>

          <p>"Well lets go celebrate with what we can buy from these, and tomorrow hunt again until we are well coordinated."</p>

          <p>"Cheers!"</p>

          <!-- <p>Days leaning up</p> -->
          <p>The next few days went by quickly, each morning Reingard would say good bye to Tisiel, I would stand around as a third wheel, we would meet up with Volker & Raina and head into the jungle of the academy, never venturing too far in.</p>

          <p>Quickly reviewing my stats so far I saw that I had no defences, very little health and was still reliant on a melee weapon. On the other hand I had high mana, high magic output, perhaps there was someway I could turn this into a defense. </p>

          <p>There is no way I can keep melee attacks from myself currently, but perhaps I could dodge them? Most will be mages and unable to make any meaningful damage with melee attacks during the arena.</p>

          <p>I can use the shoes Tisiel gave me more to dodge attacks then to help me move in quickly maybe to strike then use them to get away, but they only work after i've been stuck.</p>

          <h4>pov Tisiel</h4>
          <p>Sitting and minding his own thoughts Otto looked like he was lost in his own world again, but I had important information to share. "Otto wake up, I've made some headway on the strange symbols."</p>

          <p>"I wasn't asleep, but that is good news what did you find out?"</p>

          <p>"Right well, it's my belief that it was written by an older civilization"</p>

          <p>"Not a previous student? I guess that's something, well done."</p>

          <p>"Don't patronize me, I mean we all know we did not build the academy, that is known all over. I mean a civilization that use to be here but not apart of the original academy exactly."</p>

          <p>"Come again?"</p>

          <p>"So some civilization built the academy, the portal and the writing system found around the academy we often call runes. However these symbol's don't match, not even a little! They are from a later civilization that built on top of the academy, they built the town near by, the smaller academy, this door inside the cliffs, the cliffs as rooms!"</p>

          <p>"It's an interesting theory but what was your break though?"</p>

          <p>"The book you gave me, it's not from the academy, you found it in a market on our continent. But look at the book, it's not magical, it's not old or rotten at all. How old could it be?"</p>

          <p>"But no one uses symbol's even like this, maybe a student sold the book to the merchant, maybe its been in here the whole time."</p>

          <p>"Yes, but you found the coins on a dead body on our continent in strange clothes? The symbols on the coins are also strange, but also found throughout this book! And for the biggest reveal..."</p>

          <p>"This! There is a map inside the book of an unknown land, that shows on the next page.. A map of the academy. Which was very helpful as you can see there is an area to the left of the main academy building past the nobel area and into the jungle on that side."</p>

          <p>"Hmmm, adventure time? I have a few days more then enough time to make the trip, but it is quite deep into the jungle."</p>

          <p>"Yes well this time we won't be going alone, call it training for your arena team and we will take Shrorlei with us also, she is very strong."</p>

          <p>"Well lets meet up and head off in an hour, we were going to head into the jungle anyway today."</p>

          <p>"Let's!"</p>

          <h4>Jungle Run</h4>
          <p>The group took me though the jungle, deeper in it became hard to find the key locations on the map, the monsters here are often weaker then the other area's this is maybe why the nobles set up there houses around this area. The jungle became thick quickly on this side, the nobles who often left the work of maintaining the woodland to their peasants on our home continent had all but abandoned the idea of doing themselves here. The next landmark we were looking for on the map was a large rock, descriptive I Know, but as far as I can translate these symbol's mean large rock and there is a picture of a rock that looks like the upturned claw.</p>

          <p>"You said a large rock."</p>

          <p>"Yes, well, it is somewhat big compared to other rocks."</p>

          <p>"The other landmarks where at least 3 times the height of a man, this is. Well it's not small but it's no taller then me, how were we suppose to find this in the jungle? The damn trees are taller, this cannot be it."</p>

          <p>"Trees? Yes, there are trees." The group looked to me as if I was the one who had gone mad. "No look at the map! There are no trees, no mention of trees. If this rock where in a grassy field you would call it a big rock. But this map is drawn without trees....Why no trees?"</p>

          <p>The group made their way the rock pointed, we followed it for a few hours before stopping for lunch. I could not take my mind off the trees. There were no trees. The map maker could not of missed them, even if he overlooked the trees because they where everywhere it would be wrong to call that rock big.</p>

          <p>Reingard "Still thinking about the rock? You have that face again like there is something to solve."</p>

          <p>"I just, but the rock IS smaller then the trees and no trees are mentioned. It would be weird to note the rock if there were the trees."</p>

          <p>Reingard - "Perhaps the book is older then you thought?"</p>

          <p>Bitting down on my lip "I suppose it could be but it doesn't make sense the book cannot be more then 100 years old. Yet it has a map of the academy with no trees, and was found on the main land. Too many mysteries."</p>

          <p>Reingard "Relax a bit, we will find more answers when we arrive."</p>

          <p>Nodding, "yeah, you are right. As usual." I smiled at Reingard. It felt awkward to be around the others, I could not be myself with him like this. This time we would be looking for the landmark we came here for, it looked in the drawings stacks of squares stacked on top of each other becoming smaller to the top. Not unlike the pyramids found in Pocotcotcan literature.</p>

          <div class="pop">Landmark<img class="popOut" src="./images/inca2.png" height="400px" alt="Pyramid"></div>

          <p>It took half of the afternoon for us to find a small stream which took us to the pyramid, in among the trees and vines was a structure of squares slowly becoming smaller until on top stood the entrance way in the shape of a large stone square. Vegetation had grown all over the pyramid which had fallen hidden and unused in the jungle which had grown around it, I felt as this was more evidence to my theory but maybe I am just projecting my theory onto reality.</p>

          <p>"Explore or make camp? If we head back now we won't arrive back until late in the night, if we explore we might risk going without making camp." Reingard said.</p>

          <p>Shrorlei  - "We could make camp inside the entrance way, we could still retreat if we need to and it would shelter us a little more."</p>

          <p>Raina - "That sounds good, we brought food and water but not any camping equipment it would be good to save energy and mana on not having to build extensive shelter."</p>

          <p>The group was in agreement and we set up the stairs. It was not long before the complaints rolled in.</p>

          <p>Volker - "Carry me."</p>

          <p>Raina - "No. Carry me."</p>

          <p>Volker - "There are so many stairs!"</p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "The moss makes each step like standing on a pile of worms."</p>

          <p>Reingard - "Can't we take a break, we have awhile until night fall."</p>

          <p>Otto - "47...48....49"</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Do you HAVE to count!?"</p>

          <p>As soon as we arrived at the top the group fell down all around the top of the stairs, I stood and stared into the dark entrance, it was a large room inside, there where no lights so I threw out a manaball inside and found that there was only one thing inside the room. A large decagon table like structure inside, made of stone that sloped from the edges into the middle. On each section was a symbol, matching those from before, in the center was a small fist sized hole.</p>

          <p>While the others rested I took out my notes and copied down the symbol's and tried to match them to ones I already knew. There was four unknowns, Bone Staff, Skull Staff, two unknowns, Wing and another unknown. I started to look though the book for similar markings.</p>

           <!--  Xiquiripat ("Flying Scab") and Cuchumaquic ("Gathered Blood"), who sicken people's blood;
             Ahalpuh ("Pus Demon") and Ahalgana ("Jaundice Demon"), who cause people's bodies to swell up;
              Chamiabac ("Bone Staff") and Chamiaholom ("Skull Staff"), who turn dead bodies into skeletons;
               Ahalmez ("Sweepings Demon") and Ahaltocob ("Stabbing Demon"), who hide in the unswept areas of people's houses and stab them to death;
                and Xic ("Wing") and Patan ("Packstrap"), -->

          <h4>Volker</h4>
          <p>Seeing Tisiel distracted as soon as we arrive I light a manaball and walked around the temple, the walls where carved with scenes of everyday life, farmers, gold smiths, weapon makers & warriors. The scenes flowed one into another where on the back wall was a picture of the temple and a priest holding up an object on display for the masses blow. It suddenly felt as if cold wet eyes where looking at the back of my head.</p>

          <p>I infused fire into my manaball, the others stared at me but I was more concerned about the wet eyes that watched my actions. I breathed in. Turning suddenly and looking in the direction of the feeling, on the roof I saw another carving looking down on us.</p>

          <p>Something about the carving felt wet. It was a mess of writing of tendrils flopping and falling over each other with a pair of black eyes in the middle. They appeared to be staring at me.</p>

          <p>Raina - "What is it? That carving is a bit creepy."</p>

          <p>"Not sure, I felt like it was watching me."</p>

          <p>Reingard - "Sure is creepy. What is it Tisiel?"</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Dunno yet. Their god? Not sure."</p>

          <p>We made camp inside the room, and waited for the sun to rise the next morning. We ate the rations we brought along with us non of us wanted to go hunting in the jungle this deep at night. I kept the group warm by burning the wood we had taken from the base of the temple. I could not sleep, not with that thing watching us.</p>

          <h4>Pov Otto</h4>
          <p>Volker could not stop glancing at the marking on the roof, after awhile Volker took off into the jungle while the others slept and I was on watch. Maybe I should of stopped him.</p>

          <p>I turned back to looking though Tisiel's notes, the same marking kept coming over over and over. It's one I saw in the other places also, first the graveyard, then the door in the cliff side and now here.</p>

          <p>"Hey Tisiel, did you find out the purpose of that room?"</p>

          <p>"In the cliffside? Yeah it was a tomb which was in keeping with the mausoleum from the grave yard, they seem to take great interest in death and taking their belongings with them to the grave."</p>

          <p>"Think this place is related to death?"</p>

          <p>"Yeah, but on the flip side I am hoping to get more items for necromancy. Did you wake me up just to ask that?"</p>

          <p>"You weren't asleep. Did you see Volker leave?"</p>

          <p>"What? No, where did he go?"</p>

          <p>"Into the jungle."</p>

          <p>"Should we go after him?"</p>

          <p>"No, I think the carving was creeping him out so he will just be outside."</p>

          <p>"Okay."</p>
<!-- need skull talking to necro girl  -->
          <p>I could not help but think, all of the places we found these symbols where related to death, each was a place someone had been laid to rest with their belongings but not in the same fashion, the first was a mausoleum similar to Heilerbach's method for buying their dead rulers. The second a sealed door in a cliff side, contained a spirit trapped into a skull, and now a Pocotcotcan style pyramid.</p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "Hey Otto, Tisiel."</p>

          <p>"Oh hey you okay?"</p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "Yeah just, a door in the cliff side with a person buried with all his belongings is not the best description, that door inside the cliffside is at the back of the housing area, its deep within a tunnel really."</p>

          <p>"Yeah you're not wrong.."</p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "Not being picky as such just, you might be interested to know thats how the dwarfs burry their dead. Deep in tunnels behind doors or large rocks with the things they wanted to take with them."</p>

          <p>Otto - "The Dwarfs? You don't think these are just the resting places of the people from our continent do you? One for each style, maybe just from a previous settlement of the academy that is forgotten about?"</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "No, that has holes, the strange symbols that don't match any writing system of our own, the strange coins, the places do have similarities granted but non of them are the same, the person buried in the cliffside was no dwarf, the king buried in the graveyard with necromantic items? Heilerbach's dominant religion holds the practice as evil."</p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "So do the dwarfs."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah, this does not line up with the mainland, but yet has similarities."</p>

          <p>Otto - "Tisiel, whats this symbol mean it comes up all over the place."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Err, yeah that one is from the previous. Hold on. Monster? I thought it was monster but it makes no sense for them to be worshiping monsters, even necromancers don't worship monsters they use their bodies."</p>

          <p>Volker - "Demons." Volker's voice boomed though the room and bounced of the walls, he strode up to the table and slammed down a dead doe. The blood splattered across the table from it's wounds. Volker drew a knife and cut the animals throat and the blood ran down the table to the hole and fell inside.</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "What are you doing!? Now we can't read it. Where did you get that?"</p>

          <p>Otto - "Demons?"</p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "Is that your offering to them?"</p>

          <p>Volker nodded. "Demons always want a blood sacrifice, that thing on the roof.." His words stopped short of explaining himself as the temple began to shake. Gently at first before a large violent trust, managing to keep balance everyone was up if Volker had not woke them before and the shaking suddenly stopped. To the right of the table where it had been floor before had slid open to reveal a passageway down into the darkness.</p>

          <p>Shrorlei threw a manaball down the passageway the stairs spiraled down. I took a peek down and inside although it was hard to see where stone statue's all over. Stone warriors, Stone monsters, Stone wizards even a stone priest. Lastly there was a large stone king sitting on a stone throne. I looked to Tisiel. "A second king."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Perhaps a third? We know to little of the cliffside tomb, but I won't rule it out."</p>

          <p>Reingard & Volker & Shrorlei made their way down the stairs, followed by Raina and Tisiel. I waited looking at the doe laying dead on the table, its blood still dripping down into the hole in the middle. I looked up to see the monster carved into the roof, it did look as if it was staring at the doe which lay on the table. "Enjoy the meal."</p>

          <p>I followed after the others down into the depths of the pyramid. The others where twisting and diving their way though the statues towards the king, I decided to head over to the priest to see what kind of clues about their religion I could find out about.</p>

          <p>The priest had a ankle length robe with many colours and patters all over, some of birds and trees, not skulls or anything of death however. He held a large pole arm with an axe head and a spear head combined, it was a weapon pocotcotco warriors have been recorded using.</p>

          <h4>POV Tisiel</h4>
          <p>Down stairs were row after row of colorful statues of warriors and mages monsters and animals alike, there where a few larger then others and some so small you could keep them on your desk as a toy. The king was seated on a large throne with a crown atop his head.</p>

          <p>We made a B line to the king, dodging and weaving between the stone people. The king was as colorful as his subjects with a crown of gold and many gems embedded inside. The statue's where all painted and although clearly made of stone the work was so well done as to be life like unlike the carvings which adorned the pyramid its self outside.</p>

          <p>The kinds hands were wrapped around the chair he sat on, at his feet where offerings of food, wine, gold and weapons. Unfortunately they where just stone recreations. The only other things of note where his bodyguards and a stone tablet with the strange symbols written across them. This time however I could see the numbers which I found on some of the coins Otto had given me at the start. This was a list, of ... something.</p>

          <p>Reingard had come to stand by me, I grabbed at the hem of his trousers. He just replied with a smile. Volker and Raina had taken interest in the king for awhile before looking around and marveling at the creatures some of which I had not even seen in books yet. Shrorlei had followed us at first but now she was to be found with a manaball in hand looking at the art on the walls. It seemed like at last me and Reingard had some time alone.</p>

          <p>"You have not forgot why we came here?"</p>

          <p>"No I haven't but where to start? There is nothing of value here. I mean nothing of value we can exchange easily, I am sure the place it's self is worth a small fortune to somebody."</p>

          <p>"Hmm the boxes at the kings feet, it's in the book 10 for the demons of death and one for the lord. They might be stone but the insides should be what we came for."</p>

          <p>"Right." Reingard moved to open the stone chests quickly and quietly as the others marveled at the at the the wonders on display.</p>

          <p>Reingard stuff what he found into the bag at his waist and slide it under his cloak. As soon as he had Tisiel had finished making a sketch of the stone tablet they felt the pyramid shake again. A slow gentle rumble, building in intensity.</p>

          <p>"Time to go" I shouted, grabbing my parchments and Reingard's hard we ran dodging ducking diving back though the stone warriors and to the stairs. Volker and Raina had clearly heard me and we made to to the stairs together, Otto and Shrorlei were no where to be seen. I tugged on Reingard's hand and we climbed the stairs looking out to try and spot them, Shrorlei could not be seen, she was not a tall girl she could be behind any of these statue's. Otto was not hiding himself at all, he stood atop a 10m tall statue of a stag. I shouted to him to come quickly, but he just did not move.</p>

          <p>We waited in the room above for the other two worried the entranceway to the stairs would close any moment, when we had arrived on top the most obvious change was the doe that Volker had left on the stone table was gone. Not a trace was left not a single drop of blood. Suddenly the shaking stop. SLAM. I jumped the entrance way had shut tight.</p>

          <p>Volker - "I guess we should get another to open it up for them again.."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah, let's hunt one quickly I don't think staying inside there will be good." We made out way into the jungle together to hunt.</p>

          <h4>POV Shrorlei</h4>
          <p>I had spent my time going though the art-work on the walls when I felt the pyramid shake again, before I could make to to the stair case I saw the others move up and the lid shut. I did no panic I had food, water and they would open the lid again, if not though a new hunt then getting help from the academy. Okay maybe I was a little panicked.</p>
          
          <p>The art work had been beautiful but haunting. It had shown a war, a great war but not over land, food, water, precious gems but people. They had gone to war against other races for their people. To be precise the dwarves, elf's, gnoll's, gnomes and many I had never seen before. They took them to this temple, placed them on the tables and removed their hearts. It was hard to say why, or what they did with the hearts that was so important to them, the drawings just go into the creature of the stone statues around us now.</p>

          <p>I walked towards the stairs, I should wait there. On my way back I felt a sudden and blow to the back of my head, it felt as if my brain way trying to jump though the front of my skull as I fell face first into the ground, my nose bent on impact the blood splattered across the floor. I felt too much of a shock to move much at all the pain soon surged though me and I became overwhelmed. Reaching for my knife.</p>

          <h4>POV - Otto</h4>
          <p>The group of Reingard, Tisiel, Volker, Raina had come back holding with them some dead rabbits, sitting in the with the things they had left behind I smiled down at them, waiting for them to climb the stairs so we could pack and head home.</p>

          <p>"How, *pant* are you *pant* on the outside?"</p>
          <p>"It opens from the inside."</p>
          <p>"And you did not think to let Shrorlei out with you?"</p>
          <p>"Shrorlei? I thought she left first?" - Otto</p>
          <p>"We thought she was trapped in there with you." - Tisiel</p>
          <p>"Let's just open it back up" - Volker</p>

          <p>They had cut the rabbits on top of the table like before and spilt blood onto the table. While the others spent their time looking for Shrorlei I had opted to stay outside just incase with Tisiel. I told her I had found another coin around the priest and guardian sitting on a stone alter between them. Showing her the coin. It was similar to the coin in the last womans grave in weight & size. On her coin was a king with a skull for a face and the other a strange symbol like the symbols on the table upstairs. This new coin had the same symbol on one side and priest on the other holding a heart above a pyramid just like this one.</p>

          <p>Soon the others came up while Tisiel was checking out the new coin, she placed it back in my hand as the others come up with ugly faces. "What is wrong?" Tisiel asked quietly beside me.</p>

          <p>"Shrorlei is dead. Found her with her head beaten in and mostly crushed, a large hold in her chest. As soon as we found her we left, we should tell the academy." - Volker</p>

          <p>Otto - "I know we are in shock, but we should move quickly. What ever killed her might still be in there or of been let free, there is nothing else we can do from here."</p>

          <p>And like that we headed back for the academy, silence filled the hike home.</p>

          <h4>Tisiel, Reingard</h4>
          <p>Sitting together Reingard and Tisiel in Tisiel's room they looked over the items they got from the pyramid. 10 items in total, one matching each of the symbols on the table above. Tisiel took a staff with a skull affixed to the top which aided in the creation of skeletons. The other items would bring them in more money then they could earn working though the academy or even as mercenaries for a few years. These items where unique and that made them one of a kind, even if they were not the best combat pieces they would still be sort after.</p>

          <p>I found myself sitting back in my room holding two coins, all of this was getting a bit weird. Although we had not found a coin in the cliffside it was surely a burial place as Shrorlei had said, does not mean there was not a coin down there just I did not find it. This time Shrorlei had lost her life. For a single coin the cost was too high, but for what was learned maybe the price had to be paid.</p>

          <p>I decided to head down to Tisiel and Reingard and see what they had learned during this visit. As expected when I knocked they made me wait, sounded like they where clearing up in there but seeing them run around and pick up their clothes was not something I wanted to see. Stepping inside they stood awkwardly. "Sorry if you two where getting it on, I only came to ask about what you had translated so far."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "No no we were ... just come in it's fine, I have so much new information to look though, it's a shame the academy will be taking over the site and I won't be able to gather anymore first hand information but come take a look." She gestured me to come and sit as Reingard sat down next to her desk also. Across it was layed various books, items and coins.</p>

          <p>"The various names printed on the table were things they gave offerings to, of blood. We believe animals and possibly humans or other races but we are unsure for now. The main point is there where 10 of them and they are kind of demons, I call them this because the blood and the references to them being down under so I think this is the best translation for now." - Tisiel</p>

          <p>"What about the creature drawn above the table?"</p>

          <p>"Not one of them, although it had kind of eyes to us, it is possible we are just projecting onto it and it might of been a drawing of something else so I am not sure what that was of."</p>

          <p></p>

          <p>"Well onto the more interesting stuff. The people which made up these societies where obsessed with death, gods of death, demons of death and the practice of necromancy which is perfect for me that they died out and the practice is not as wildly used because what was theirs is now mine."</p>

          <p>"As long as I get stronger I don't mind joining these expeditions. Although I cannot say I have a need or interest in necromancy. I am sure you will become one of the legends said to raise whole armies from the dead."</p>

          <p>"Aha, I am happy with just a few cute skeleton helpers here and there. I don't plan on becoming a combat mage anyway. You might be more interested to know that the coins while they are magic items according to this..." Tisiel flipped though her note book and the book from the market to show me her notes. "They are a type of single use item."</p>

          <p>"So I can use them but only once? How do I use the coins? What do they do?"</p>

          <p>"Ah, you place them on your eyes, what to do is vague at best, something about their gods maybe demons? I would say beings worthy or pray?"</p>

          <p>"So I am just going to have to try them to find out? Seems like a waste, it might be better to sell them."</p>

          <p>"Yeah, I was thinking the same. I am sorry Otto I thought they would be more useful since they were found in important sites I really don't understand."</p>

          <p>"Well I'll keep hold of them maybe we can shed more light on them in the future, it's not like I can sell them for the right price by saying I have no idea what they do, and when you use them they will be gone forever."</p>

          <p>"Yeah...Sorry..."</p>

          <p>"No worries, I am going to head back out and leave you two to .. studying."</p>

          <p>"Later!" - Reingard</p>
          <p>"Come round anytime!" - Tisiel</p>

          <p>I left them and headed up topside to the training ground for the cliffside, overlooking the academy it was a nice place to come to, but today I did have something to practice. I had not told Tisiel everything that had happened down in that pyramid or everything I knew of the coins.</p>

          <p>I got down on the floor and started to pray. I was never a religious man but I had found faith down in that pyramid. Praying was common in Alden, for those that had faith they could be granted spells or skills by the ones they pray to. I soon got a reply.</p>

          <!-- Title Here -->

          <p>"Hunt the stag."</p>

          <p>A blinding pain filled my brain as images and information followed though. It was not just any stag that would do, an elemental creature the thunder stag. Most elemental creatures are rare, hard to find and tricky to handle. I imagine such a creature is far stronger then myself. I had got my first quest and I knew what I had to do, that was a start.</p>

          <p>To help me along I had been granted 1 faith. I could use this to cast a spell of the deities choice and recharge it daily though prayer. I opened the menu to see what spell I had been granted, it was unlikely the spell could be changed.</p>

          <p>"Kʼawiil's lightning seeds. Plant the seeds of lighting on a target and lightning skills will be amplified."</p>

          <p>Ekʼ Chuah was not a lightning god, lightning demon or anything of the sort. Where in the hell did Ekʼ Chuah get a lightning power from and who was Kʼawiil? Too many questions, questions I feel I won't be getting the answers to.</p>

          <!-- <p>God L grans the Power of god K though faith.</p> -->

          <!-- Gods of worship require pray for awhile to grant faith based classes and then faith spells, gods of no worship have their attention on one or few individuals and are able to grand faith spells before to increase their following. Often gods fall out of fashion due to religious wars and differences or societal pressure. And you can get faith spells from the new god, maybe there spells suit you better or your society finds more acceptable the requirements such as the hunt or sacrifice will be popular before are not popular now. -->

          <p>I went on the trip to become stronger, I had become stronger but not in the way I had hopped I had no more defences then when I left the arena rounds would start tomorrow the best I could do now was practice with my new skill get some rest and hope for good match ups.</p>

          <p>I set off and headed to the arena, I met up with Reingard, Volker and Raina there. We would head into the armory below the arena, most students by now had their own weapons or had a set weapon they would use it was very rare for a student to change their weapon this far into the year. I would not be changing mine from my warhammer anytime soon.</p>

          <p>Raina had a two handed staff with patterns of water craved throughout, Volker carried a wand with a small shield. Reingard however had come with a large metal chain around his neck and a large metal shield in his hand.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Reingard."</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Otto."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Don't play dumb, what is that?"</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Ah, I got this yesterday. I had managed to exchange some things for them. This is a metal kite shield imbue.."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Not the shield."</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Didn't even let me finish. Fine, its a magic chain weapon I exchanged for something important I had. I just could not resist it matches my element so well. Take a look."</p>

          <li>Primary:<font color="blue">Kusari-fundo (half)</font> +3 Dexterity, can be extended or move with mana.</li>

          <p>Otto - "How the hell do you plan to use this thing while holding a shield?"</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Ah well it's only a half length so this is a handle, and the other end is weighted not both, think of it like a metal whip, because of my element I can exert some level of control over it."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Alright.. Just don't hit me in the back of the head with it."</p>
          <p>Reingard - "I promise not to hit you in the back of the head."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Or the front"</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Ot the front."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Just, don't hit me anywhere with it! Your words make me uneasy!"</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Aha, I will not hit you with it."</p>

          <p>It was not long before the four of us found ourselves waiting at the foot of the entrance way to the arena, I had walked it before but that was when the arena was split and both combatants would enter though the same gate, it felt different this time. We walked the long curved tunnel up to the arena entrance the light at the end of the tunnel spread around the mouth of the exit. Blinded, our eyes soon adjusted and before us was a metal gate holding us back from entering the arena, the opposite team already waiting behind theres.</p>

          <p>Arena Guard -- "You can move around in your half of the arena before the match stats, position how you like, set traps and cast spells but if you make a move, spell or anything else to the other half of the arena or combatants before the match stats you will be disqualified. Good luck."</p>

          <p>There was a metallic screech and rumble as the bars fell into the earth, small holes left behind and we stepped out into the arena. We had 20 seconds to get ourselves into position and be ready to fight. The floor of the arena had a thin coating of sand not enough to effect walking but enough to soak up the blood I guess.</p>

          <p>The opposing team was also a group of four, more traditional mage group with staffs, wands and a dai-furyo (hand fan). Reingard was stood in front of me a little to my left and Volker in front of Raina to our left. The match started with the sounding of a large bell, I opened with a wall of lightning wall in front of Volker's opponents, turning my attention to Reingard who had thrown his chain while keeping his shield up trying to strike a mage with a wand in the back, when they moved Reingard adjusted the path with his mana and stuck him in the stomach, the mage keeled over but was not out.</p>

          <p>The mage in front of us with a staff slammed it to the ground in response broken earth and soil where flung at Reingard's eyes. I put on my lightning cloak spell and Charged Charge into the staff wielding mage. I swung my warhammer high and he moved his staff high colliding together in a test of strength he lost badly (-17% health). Testing out my new faith spell I threw my left hand open and the seeds materialized and landed on him, clinging to him like barbed plants.</p>

          <p>In return the wand mage stuck me with a lighting manaball, the earth mage followed up with an infused manaball of his own but I activated my boots and bounced behind Reingard who tanked the blast with his shield. As we moved forward my hand on his shoulder his shield up, I took the time to see how Volker and Raina where holding up. The arena near them had the air filled with flames and the ground covered in water, as the fan mage blew back the flames with his wind magic the other wand mage blew across the tip of his wand as a black cloud of smoke bellowed from the end and glided across the arena.</p>

          <p>As we moved in range of these two mages Reingard charged into the lightning mage, I bounced out from behind him and struck the earth mage with chain-lightning. The seeds activated doing their job, a full 28% of his health disappeared and the bolt flew off to meet his friend. The earth mage was hanging just above 50% hp at this point, I was sure I could take him alone but was not confident I would leave the fight with the ability to help the others. I dashed back to see Reingard managing to hold off the lighting mage with ease but unable to inflict any serious damage, he would be okay if I left him with both mages for awhile out left flank is falling back.</p>

          <p>The wand mages poison gasses had been burned up by Volker where he could but they where not looking the healthiest right now. The air mage used his large fan to move the poison clouds about and beat back the fire Volker had sent their way. Raina's water magic was great for healing but could not inflict any damage on her opponent's and like this they had been gaining the upper hand.</p>

          <p>I bolted my way across the arena and activated charged charge, at almost 300 mana to start with I had dropped to about 80% remaining. The wind mage blow a gust my way but I did not stop, and collided with the poison mage, the lighting cloak flew off me and ran into him like a bolt as my warhammer met the side of his head. His body disappeared from the arena, the judges must of thought this a lethal blow. One down.</p>

          <p>The wind mage backed up by pushing the wind in front of him and using it to glide backwards 1 meter, he was out of my range at over 1 meter since I could not charge with magic again so soon. "Help Reingard" I shouted to the others, I heard them run off away from me as I tried to corner the wind mage.</p>

          <p>I ran straight for him trying to finish him off also when I was hit with a wind infused manaball, the blow had come so quick I did not register it at first (-43%). I could not allow him to keep that up, I stuck with lightning strike (-57%), he had high magic defences it seems. I sprinted into him with my warhammer striking his chest, his body soon disappeared from the arena as I felt a huge pressure above me push me down and a sucking woosh, next thing I saw was the arena underground where I had come in, standing next to an small water fountain at the base of the entrance tunnel to the area. I must of reached my last 10 hp, guess he still had enough mp left to use strike also.</p>

          <!-- mana drain is power of spell * 10?  -->

          <!-- lightning cloak, shocking touch, chain lighting, charged charge and wall of lightning.
Mana ball (lightning) (Pow: 1), Tether, Magic resistance (passive), Magic up (passive), Strike (lightning) (Pow: 2),  Magic regen (passive) -->

          <p>Soon enough my team mates came back down the tunnel, walking, they had won the rest of the match with Raina's healing waters they were able to grind though the rest of their health.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Welcome back!"</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Perhaps next time you could join us in walking back down."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I'll work on it."</p>

          <p>The was the end of our first match, we would not have to participate again until the next drawings in a week, with that in mind I took some time to watch some of the other matches.</p>

          <h4>Spectator - POV commentator</h4>
          <!-- Oblivion easter egg / arena dialogue -->
            <p>"Welcome, welcome, to the Arena!"</p>
            <p>We have two teams for you today, on the right the green team, and on the left the red team!</p>
            <p>"You came to watch a fight, and a fight you shall have! It's a second year student team showdown in a battle to determine the victor! Lower the gates!"</p>
            <p>The green team is made up of all fire-mages, perhaps they should of been the red team! The red team is a mixed group of water, ice, wind and light! This should be quite the showdown!</p>
            <p>A heated start, the green team had throw fireballs, waves of flames and wisps all across the field! Red team rebutted with waterballs, ice walls, and a large gust of wind subduing the raging flames! A light has filled the arena shining in the eyes of the green team! What a start!</p>
            <p>Green team are putting on the pressure again, fireballs and flamethrowers trying to group up the red team, the ice spears and water walls only doing so much to hold them back, light magic while powerful in areas is really struggling to hold back the flames it might be we have our first out.</p>
            <p>What is this! Green team's team captain is summoning a fire elemental! This could be a game changer! Red team where already launching a plan of their own! Red teams wind mage has launched herself into the air!</p>
            <p>Now she is airborne her wind infused manaballs are raining down  on the summoning mage with no defense to be found! This explains the green teams aggressive start they where doing it to protect their captain!</p>
            <p>With their plan just a distant memory the green team are breaking down, some are shooting fireballs up others still trying to apply pressure, but with the split red team are making short work of green team.</p>
            <p>"My friends, we have a winner! Behold, the combatants from the red Team! If you bet on the red Team, see the merchants to collect your winnings!"</p>

          <!-- Date 3 -->
          <h4>Fair Date</h4>
                    <!-- Gives Tsuma the witches hat -->
          <p>Tsuma - "I have always wanted to be a witch, the kind of a broomstick, big witch hat, and a black cat."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Just like the fairy tales, you would make a beautiful witch zooming though the sky on your broomstick."</p>
          <p>Tsuma - "Aww, yeah something like that." She said softly and looked away a bit embarrassed by the compliments.</p>
          <p>Otto - "Oh, I got you a gift." I took out the witches hat from my bag and handed it to her. "It's for you, it's a witches hat and a magic item so you can wear it whenever you like."</p>
          <p>Tsuma - "Really? Really? It's for me? I can keep it? It's really expensive, you should use it for yourself."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I would not make a great witch, I mean I use a warhammer for a start, it looks better on you, and I have another head piece so I really don't need it, it's yours now, it's a gift."</p>
          <p>Tsuma - "Thank you." She replied with the cutest face, head down and holding onto the hat with two hands.</p>
          <p>Otto - "Put it on let's see."</p>
          <p>The hat fit her perfectly, it was a magical item after all and would always fit perfectly.</p>

          <h4>tomb raid</h4>
          <!-- Have item the mask, wand to detect magic, bouncy shoes. Titles & race! -->
          <p>No sooner had I made it back inside of the cliff side I was ambushed by Tisiel and Reingard. The excitement on their faces left me feeling excited too I could not help but give a smile from ear to ear. Am I getting addicted to plundering the resting places of the dead? Something like this should horrify me.. What would my family think. Shaking of the cob-web like feeling of the ethics behind it I had to ask what they had found out this time.</p>

          <p>Tisiel had told me she had found the location of another tomb, unlike the last times this tomb was not near the academy, or even above ground. While the cliff side study was underground the entrance was very visible if it had not been for the restrictions placed on the door and the genal acceptance that the cliff side was nothing worth thinking about another mage would of surely broken in before us.</p>

          <p>The tomb was located over 300km away from the academy, this would not be a short sally out into the forest but a long expedition. We would need to sign out of the academy to do something like this, if we just up and leave without saying anything the academy might follow us and if they discover the tomb for themselves they might take all of the treasure as they have with the pyramid even banning us from going by saying it was dangerous. Well, Shrorlei had died but there was always danger involved when taking from the dead.</p>

          <p>Reingard put forward a plan, one I was not to keen on but if it worked then we might just get back without pulling too much attention to ourselves. After all once might of been luck, but if we discover an old tomb twice, people would start asking questions.</p>
          <!-- Tisiel" Reingard".  -->

          <p>In the morning the next day we made our way into the academy, Reingard went off to get food and other miscellaneous supplies. I made my way into one of the cafe's with Tisiel, we took a table with 4 chairs and spread out a map across the table.</p>

          <!-- unique race, lighting resistance, lightning trap -->

          <p>We had not been there more then 1 hour before we were approached by a group of older students in the 3rd year, they made to block any exit routes before asking about our maps, where we were going, what had we found. This kind of treatment was obviously taboo and they would never behave like this with other students. However we were not normal students, we where students in the first year, from the cliffs, there was no way we had any backing.</p>

          <p>There was 5 of them in total, the first to approach us and speak had a sly smile across his face, hair pushed back as if he had just run both his greasy hands though his hair. Since they where in the 3rd year they must be doing their work experience here in the academy. At least we could be sure they were not direct combat mages. The only reason a mage might stay is to study theory under one of the professors.</p>

          <p>"Look, we know you are the ones who came across that pyramid. You should of had us with you then you might of made it back with some of those treasures before the academy could lay claim to all of them. Tell you what if one of you dies again on this trip we promise not to tell the academy, and if you don't die we will even help you keep one treasure. How generous is that? Thats 100% more treasure then you kept last time. What do you say?"</p>

          <p>I had to hand it to him, he would be great at selling water to fish. The words clearly stated he did not care if we lived or died as long as he got his hands on some treasure and made it sound like it was a great deal for us. I gave a small passing smile to Tisiel, it seems we would have no choice but to bring them with us if we didn't want the academy finding out.</p>

          <p>Before we had a chance to reply, his hand slammed down in the middle of the table bringing the attention of everyone in the cafe.</p>

          <p>"What's it gonna be!?" As he looked between us my eyes flitted over to Tisiel, he quickly picked up on this. Tisiel would be hard pressed to forgive me for that mistake. Staring at Tisiel he spoke slowly. "So you are the brains are you? Figures, this guys has too much muscle to be a real mage".</p>

          <p>As those words left his mouth I could not help but wonder how skinny he was under that robe. I was by no means a mountain of muscles, even Reingard was larger then I was. However everyone here knew muscles would not help in a fight between mages as most mages do not put any stat points into strength so their muscles would just be for show.</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Looks like we have no choice but to welcome you on our trip..."</p>

          <p>"Hey don't say it so defeated, this is a good thing for you. We are your seniors after all, you are more likely to come out alive with us around, you might learn something and if you are really lucky maybe you will catch one of our eyes.." The last line came out with a creepy drawl.</p>

          <p>All we could do was sit there as they joined us at the table and we told them when and where we were going and what we had found at the pyramid, we might of embellished a little when it came to the amount treasure found and lied a little about where the treasure was now, namely in the hands of some of the professors at the academy. Thankfully they believed us thinking that we were so inferior it never crossed their minds that we would lie to them, or maybe it just lined up with that they thought was already true. Either way, to be sure, I had no doubts that we would go "missing" during this trip of ours, and after our rooms would be turned over.</p>

          <p>Our discussion continued for another few hours, we agreed that they would pick us up and take us to the location of the tomb. We would provide them with our understanding of the previous tombs, and act as guides, no doubt this meant guinea pigs for the various traps there could be found throughout such old tombs. In return they would offer us protection, both from the various monsters and the academy by providing them academy with the explanation that we were occupying them as field hands for their studies. This would actually lift the suspicions of the academy members as such group outings where not uncommon as a benefit to both parties and would likely never venture anywhere too dangerous or be able to find anything that would interest or value for the academy to step in.</p>

          <p>One month later they arrived outside of the cliffs early in the morning. The 5 from the cafe and one more who we did not know or agree upon. Tisiel & Reingard where up waiting in the living area down stairs before I had made it down, since the 3rd years where unwilling or unable to get into the cliff side we had a small window of time to double check our side of the plan. After all there was no way we were really going to agree to what they have suggested in the cafe.</p>

          <p>With fake smiles placed on our faces, inventory full of supplies and academy robes on our backs we left to meet with the group waiting outside. The awkward greetings over they quickly informed us the new guy was given permission to go into the field for his studies and could take others with him as help. This way they could pass though without raising any suspicions during a time when the academy was clamping down on student exploration outside of the academy grounds.</p>

          <p>The target was a cave entrance far to the north of the academy, Tisiel claimed that her sources state the cavern of despair has not been discovered this age and would hold the relics and treasures of most of the past civilizations. Each civilization to discover the cavern have used it as an armory and last line of defense. The reason being is once you have control over the cave you can activate the ancient sealing and defensive spells, such spells are unheard of in modern times and make the cave a perfect safe. Lucky for us, no one is currently occupying the cave.</p>

          <p>All of this leads to the assumption that when each civilization discovered the ruins of the others and plundered it for what might of been useful the items, texts and anything of real value would of been moved into the cave. What was left behind might be of value to us in the modern day but to them was not worth as much as what they stored away.</p>

          <p>It took a few days travel the we found our selves far beyond the sight of the academy, in a field where the grass grew to the hight of a tall man. The blades seem sharp to the touch and would leave paper cuts on your bare skin if you where not careful. We were harassed by large flying beatles around level 1 ~ 4 ambushing us in quick raids. A melee attack was too hard, they where the size of a fist up to the size of a skull but moved too quickly so magic worked better.</p>

          <p>After a week of this we found that the grass started to grow shorter and we eventually found sand, the academy had taken an interest in this sand during its foundation and initial exploration of the land around it, the sand contains traces of mana inside, not enough to be useful as studies showed but it was still of interest, after a few more days we found that the grasslands had been replaced by a desert of this sand, with sandstorms raging constantly inflicting small damage as we went.</p>

          <p>After more traveling Tisiel finally shouted over the sound of rushing sand, "Should be near by, watch out for places where the sand looks like it's sinking in, it's either the cave entrance or a sink pit."</p>

          <p>To be honest, even with the supplies we brought along and knowledge of the area from the academy, I would not of predicted just how tired everyone had become, by now the party only spoke if they had to, the fake faces had fallen away.</p>

          <p>It was at this point the voice of my God spoke to me, "This land is the death lands. You should go back. You are not strong enough to be here."</p>

          <p>"I am not strong enough to run away either, all I can do is pray you watch over me as your only follower."</p>

          <p>"...Who told you I had no other followers!?"</p>

          <p>"Ah, well your temple is abandoned, your people gone and the worship of a God of death is ... frowned upon."</p>

          <p>"No longer abandoned, full of your people now. My people also did not worship death at first, no one choses death if they have another choice. My people chose death at the end, like those before us. That is why there is always temples to death left behind. You should know. You also chose their path, you chose me."</p>

          <p>A long pause filled the air as the group looked around silently for the holes in the sand, exhausted and on guard. "So are you going to help me out? I will help you out in return."</p>

          <p>"It's not like I don't need you, it's the only reason I am feeding you power. I could set you a task with a high reward... But there are rules about what can be done. Let see what I can do. In return, later I need more followers, the other Gods of death must have also woken and be building their power base."</p>

          <p>"Deal, any task that helps me get out of this mess would work just fine."</p>

          <p>The sand whipped our faces, Reingard almost fell into a sand trap. One of the 3rd years did get his foot stuck in one, lost his boot in the process of being dragged out, he had a fat face, bulbous ruddy nose and crooked front tooth. Ditwin was his name, an earth mage specialising in rocks mostly. During the fights with the beatles in the grasslands his abilities produced great rocks the size of a mans chest for both defense and offence but in the end achieved very little with his poor accuracy.</p>

          <p>It was Linhart that first found the cave entrance by chance, the leader of this group and an adept fire mage from a fire mage family. Between all of the 3rd years he was the most capable mage and the highest level thanks to his family. He had stumbled into a sand trap only to try and blast his way out with fire, lucky for him it was the entrance to the cave and not a trap otherwise all he would of done was fused the sand together while still inside.</p>

          <p>We all scrambled into the cave entrance, it was half the height of a man at the mouth but once inside and down the entrance slope the roof stood at over 30 meters up. What was most surprising was that at first I expected to be plunged into complete darkness but the rocks inside of the cave gave off a weird ethereal blue glow here and there. Wisps of blue light danced across the walls, rushing from one side and disappearing just as quickly as it sprang to life.</p>

          <p>We spend about a day milling around and recouping ourselves, as far as we knew this was the only way in or out and we could leave behind some of the supplies for the return journey. The plan was to go in and map out the ruins as best we could, find anything of interest and head back.</p>

          <p>We went in as expected, Tisiel, Reingard, Myself, followed by Ditwin, Gelfrat, Hildebold, Linhart, Nymandus and finally Petsche. The reason we were first? Well that was because if there was any traps, guess who would be the ones to find out the hard way.</p>

          <p>After a short walk though the tunnel wide enough to stand only 2 by 2 we soon exited though to another larger cavern. Before us was a giant temple, with columns stretching far into the air but not touching the roof, they appeared to be randomly placed coming out of the ground with nothing on top. In the middle was a large building with an open entrance. All of this was raised into the air on several platforms.</p>

          <p>Before we could reach even the first platform there was a large distance between us and it. Clearly this area would be filled with traps, death and trickery. However the place felt calm as if the atmosphere down here was asleep, undisturbed for a long time, I would bet non of the traps here where active, expect if I made such a bet it could cost me my life.</p>

          <p>Just as we were standing in awe, Ditwin shoved all three of us from behind. "Move it. We came for treasures not site seeing." He grunted out angrily as if he would even be down here without us. As we neared the temple Ditwin shouted out "Hey once we are inside don't touch any of the treasures, they might be traps." Gelfrat started to snicker next to him as soon as he said this.</p>

          <p>Tisiel, Reingard and Myself just looked at each other, it was not their first time searching ruins but it was clearly not ours either. Resisting the urgh to speak back, we were the first to step inside. Inside was a stone alter in the middle of the room and three doors ahead of us with a symbol on each. Around the room with even spacing between them was 9 statues, each holding different weapons and wearing masks adorned with feathers.</p>

          <p>They where not like the statues found in the pyramid, made of clay and stone. These where made of the same black stone found around the cave which gave off a strange lightblue glow across their surfaces now and again. On the alter was an indented hand print and some writing in the strange symbol's around the hand print in a circle.</p>

          <p>As Tisiel was attempting to translate what it said Gelfrat walked right up to the alter. "It's a hand print you morons it needs a hand." Gelfrat said as he proceeded to push his hand into the indent. To nobody elses shock this was a mistake, a few spikes pushed up into and though Gelfrat's hand and out the other side regardless of skin or bones. Blood dripped down the spikes and flowed across his hand filling the indent. His screaming filled the round hall bouncing off the walls so that we could not even think clearly.</p>

          <p>Soon as the indent was filled with blood the spikes retracted and he was free. He fell to the floor and fainted. "A blood price must be paid, willingly or not. That's the translation. A slaves hand would be put onto here to give up their blood if no one was willing, you can see in the carved pictures around the bottom of the alter people cutting their palms and sharing the blood cost." Tisiel chimed in almost sounding a little too happy about the translation.</p>

          <p>"Why did you not say that sooner!?" Ditwin spat out.</p>

          <p>"He gave me no time." Tisiel replied without a care.</p>

          <p>"Earth ball!" Ditwin called mana though his body into his hand in the shaped of a ball and fused his earth element within, as soon as the rock was formed he shot it towards Tisiel.</p>

          <p>Tisiel tried to dodge out of the way but combat was not her strong point and so moved far to slow and a loud 'Thud' noise arrived as the rock hit her in the shoulder. She screamed out in pain and Reingard ran to her side and shot a frosty look at Ditwin and reached for his sword.</p>

          <p>"Now, now. There is no need for violence. Gelfrat honorably gave up his blood so we may enter. No one would believe he was fool enough to now know what he was doing, he knew all along. Now put down your anger..." Linhart walked though the middle of the two parties that had formed.</p>

          <p>Ditwin had the face of a raging storm but did not keep up the assault. Tisiel injured stayed in Reingard's arms looking back with a cold stare, Reingard did not take his hand off his blade but did not move knowing the 3rd years would not side with him he would have to hold his tongue for now.</p>

          <p>Soon after Hildebold, Nymandus and Petsche filled into the room making it quite the squeeze in here with the statues surrounding us. "You arguing about which path to take? We could just split up." Petsche said as he walked in seeing the small stand off.</p>

          <p>"Path?" No sooner had Linhart asked a cold wind pushed past us without enough force to blow our hair around, turning back all 3 passageways had opened during our little fight and the smell coming from them was like weeks of rotten milk.</p>

          <p>"Smells worse then Ratboy." Petsche added. Linhart and Hildebold started to giggle holding back laughter as Gelfrat stared fixed at Petsche, as he was about to say something Ditwin interrupted everyone "Smells worse then 1st years more like." Awkward silence filled the room again. Nymandus never said a word just pinched his nose at the smell and looked at the bloody alter and furrowed his brows.</p>

          <p>"Right, Ditwin and Gelfrat go left you two should be able to find gold." Linhart gave orders out to each to make groups, before he had finished Ditwin and Gelfrat walked off first down the left route before they could be stuck with some 1st year. "Reingard, Tisle, Hildebold & Petsche go in the middle. Nymandus and myself and Otto will go right."</p>

          <p>As we stepped up to the entrances Tisle whispered to me, "The doors are marked easy, medium and hard. Be careful in there." I gave a short nod and walked though.</p>
          
          <h4>Vault Tomb</h4>

          <p>We walked in single file up some stairs. At the top where bridges all leading in different directions and non of the staying still. Some moved up and down others left and right as they attached themselves to different exits at the other end. The bridges sometimes moved slowly and other times jerked suddenly as if to throw off whoever was walking on them, this would undoubtedly work as the bridges where very narrow.</p>

          <p>"Really? A dexterity test for mages?" Linhart seemed to recognize this arrangement as being a test for dexterity, it made sense that he might know about these things as his family where landed knights in one of the provinces. No doubt his family had access to more knowledge and a better understanding of the world then my own.</p>

          <p>He pulled a small vile filled with green liquid from his cloak, drank it all in one and jumped onto a bridge and started running. As the bridge below him moved he kept his balance, when it jolted hard he seemed to bounce and land back on it. "Dexterity potion, it raises your dexterity for a short period of time." Nymandus said from behind me as I watched, as I was about to reply the bridge suddenly jolted left and then back right, this threw Linhart off and he went falling down below.</p>

          <p>Luckily there was enough bridges that he just landed on another further down. Nymandus just let out a small sigh and turned to me, pushed his hands out palm up and said some strange words, I felt myself become lighter and more agile. "What was that?" I asked. "Blessing of my God, we should have higher dexterity now, let's try to get across" he replied while casting the same blessing onto himself.</p>

          <p>"Wish me luck." I said to myself more then Nymandus and jumped onto a passing bridge. I ran along the moving bridge for about 4 paces before it jerked violently to the right and I fell. I hit my shoulder on the bridge below and rolled off to the side landing on another further down. Linhart laughed but then soon paled when he saw Nymandus stroll across the bridges with a zig zag walk that let him walk across without falling down once. Now we were split up it seemed that each of us would face the next trial alone, looking at the dark entrance I stepped inside before waiting for the others.</p>

          <p>Inside of the entrance was a rounded area with a door at the opposite end, a few skeletons and a symbol above the door. While I was no good at deciphering I recognize this as the number 5. No doubt Nymandus was looking at the number 1 and Linhart the number 3, if it matched the amount of entrances we missed by falling down. Without Nymandus's blessing though I would of fallen so far I would of either died or seen the number 100.</p>

          <p>The room was quite simple, apart from the door at the far end the only thing to note was the large body of water in the middle of the room, leaving a small gap around the edge of the room to walk on. Just as I was about to step in and walk around his voice whispered in my ear.</p>

          <p>"Scratches."</p>

          <p>For an all powerful God he sure seemed like he was saving his power to comminate. But of course I stopped and looked around some more. The fuck dose he mean scratches? Did he give me a nickname like a cat? Maybe he is playing with a cat up there...</p>

          <p>I looked across the water and around the edges, I looked at the roof the walls, and even the gaps between the water and the walls. I was about to give up on this senile old God when I noticed scratch marks, they where faint but maybe 3cm long from the gap down into the water. Clearly if I tried to walk around something would drag me into the water. Did the fall from the bridges damage my brain? We are inside a vault or tomb or whatever this place was in the past it is a tomb now, of course it wouldn't be as easy as walking around.</p>

          <p>Kicking a nearby pebble into the water... No reaction. Maybe the thing died in there after all this time...</p>

          <p>I gathered a ball of mana into the palm of my hand, and infused lightning into it until it was glowing blue, sparking and ready to break apart and threw it into the water. 1, 2, 3, nothing ... Then the water started to splash around and kick up waves, the walls got soaked and just as suddenly it stopped.</p>

          <p>So did I electrocute it's body and dispute being dead that caused it to move, or did I shock it and it's still alive? So I threw 2 more inside.</p>

          <p>Just as before, waves kicked up the water roiled and suddenly stopped. So I threw a few more down. After the 20th or so ball a giant writing red monster with tentacles of unknown length, eyes as big as my whole body and a head as large as the room burst up from the water. It lurched forward stopped by an unknown force keeping it from going past a few centimeters outside of the water and opened a hole below it, spikes ran along the hole and out from inside came a huge roar. Spit and bile sprayed all over also being stopped by the unknown force falling onto the floor below and like slop rolled back into the water.Then, it spoke. "Stop tickling me! Are you here to torment me? I was asleep for so long then awoken by your constant tickling!"</p>

          <p>"I was just seeing if you where still alive..."</p>

          <p>"Well I am, so be on your way."</p>

          <p>"Are you gonna pull me into the water if I walk past?"</p>

          <p>"Well not anymore! If you came down to check if I am still alive you must be that monsters apprentice, just get out of here and tell him I am alive and doing as he commanded. DO NOT TELL HIM I WAS ASLEEP!"</p>

          <p>"Alright deal, I'll tell him you where awake and doing a good job and you won't drag me down. Would be embarrassing for us both if he had to come down and get me out."</p>

          <p>"Hmph!" And with that the monster dove back into the water.</p>

          <p>Not sure if he was still listening I quickly skipped around the edge. True to his word he did not drag me down, as I pushed open the door to the other side he flicked his tentacle and splashed water up my back... It was as cold as ice, but honestly although I looked miffed inside I was just pleased I had not become dinner.</p>
          
          <!-- Re do with a lion? -->
          <p>As the door closed behind, I made my way up the winding stairs and saw the next symbol... of course it stood for the number four. Pushing the door open inside were three coffins. I needed no warning to know this place was dangerous, I was lucky to get past the last, but unless the dead could talk and be tricked ... easily ... then I don't think this will be easy.</p>

          <p>The skeletons in this room where too many to count, the floor itself seem to be made of the bones of failures. Bite marks accompanied the length of each and every bone, death in here would mean becoming food. I sat down cross legged and tried to look around as much as I could for clues or just an idea. A lot of time passed, I am not sure how long but I got bored. I coated myself with the lightning cloak and walked onto down the few stairs and onto the floor. I crept forward slowly... and could only wonder if they too had fallen asleep...</p>

          <p>BANG!</p>

          <p>One of the coffin lids jolted a little making a small gap between the coffin and the lid. A sound was coming from inside, it was intense screaming and scraping, the scream sounded like two stones where being rubbed together. My ear drums wanted to burst from the pain.</p>

          <p>I ran holding my ears as they bleed out down my cheeks, I almost made it to the door at the far side when loud bangs started to come from the other coffins, red hand and long arm attached shot out from the larger gap being made by the constant banging from inside, the end of the hand looked burnt the nails long and black launched at my head. I grabbed hold of the door and pulled it open and tried to pull it closed behind me as the coffin lid finally fell from the coffin onto the floor, the last thing I saw was eyeballs held into a rotting skull by over stretched red muscles the eyeball was tinged yellow ******</p>
          <!-- starvation symptoms -->

          <!-- Bridge or riddles? -->

          <p>The door was marked with 3 lines, while this was one of the symbols, it stood for 3 and did not take much to translate. On the other side of the door was yet another weird room, there was no floor this time just a bottomless black pit with mist rising from below. Across which was an old wood and rope bridge which swang in the .... lack of wind. Sitting at the foot of the bridge was Linhart. He gave me a quick look over his shoulder before saying. "So the stairs outside lead down to the other entrances?"</p>

          <p>"Yeah. Best not to go backwards though. What's with this bridge? Is there another monster that pulls you off?"</p>

          <p>"Another? Hmm not quite, there is some kind of ghost in the middle that pushes you off if you cannot answer his riddle."</p>

          <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

          <p>"... I have my methods."</p>

          <p>"Okay. What was the riddle?"</p>

          <p>"What is black and white and red all over?"</p>
          
          <p>Some part of me just wanted to laugh. "That's it? What's the trick?"</p>

          <p>"Confident? You are welcome to go first."</p>

          <p>"Hmmm what was your first answer?"</p>

          <p>"... Angry badger."</p>

          <p>Keeping the best straight face I could. "Well you are not wrong..."</p>

          <p>"Trust me, it was wrong."</p>

          <p>I almost lost myself laughing, this guy was the leader of the group that joined ours, if they where all like this guy I feel like none of them will make it into the inner tomb alive. I strode forward and onto the bridge and started making my way to the middle. "You got a death wish!?" Linhart shouted from behind me. The mist coming from below gathered into a figure in the middle of the bridge to block my path.</p>

          <p>"To pass you must answer a riddle, get it wrong and you will be removed from the bridge into the pit blow. What is black and white and red all over?"</p>

          <p>"A newspaper." I replied casually. The ghost gave a short nod and dispersed back into mist surrounding the bridge. I turned to see Linhart gaping at me. "How did you know the answer? Newspapers aren't even red!" He shouted across from where he sat.</p>

          <p>"Read as in reading not red as in the colour." With that short reply I turned and finished crossing the bridge. "You know the answer now so you might as well come over." I shouted across to Linhart. With a red face and some hesitation he stepped onto the bridge and again the ghost formed in the middle.</p>

          <p>"To pass you must answer a riddle, get it wrong and you will be removed from the bridge into the pit blow. The more of this there is, the less you see. What is it?"</p>

          <p>Linhart blanked. The look on his face of panic and deep thought. The answer again was obvious, was this just to keep children out? What was even the purpose of this riddle ghost? "Hurry up already." I shouted across.</p>

          <p>"I don't know the answer the riddle has changed you bastard!" Linhart shouted back to me.</p>

          <p>"That is incorrect." With out any hint of emotion the ghost dissipated back into mist and Linhart was flung off the bridge and shot into the dark pit blow with a look of despair and anger on his face, screaming the whole way down.</p>

          <p>On reflection I guess the ghost takes your first reply as your answer. Still was it so hard? Maybe it was, maybe because my dad told me childish riddles everyday I find this kind of thing easy. With a shrug I walked though the door and up the stairs to the door marked with two.</p>

          <h4>part 2</h4>

          <p>As soon as I opened the door I saw Nymandus standing in the middle of the room, he turned and looked directly at me. "I was just coming down to get you both, Linhart is not with you?"</p>

          <p>"He fell... How did you get here? And how did you know I would be here?"</p>

          <p>"Hmm? The first door was marked with one line, once I cleared that floor I saw the real entrance, this whole bridge set up looks like an after thought, an add on to the original. I came back to the stairs that lead down and came into this room, while it was easier then the first I guess I still took to long to save Linhart. How did you make it up and not him? He was stronger then you."</p>

          <p>"You cleared a floor? The monsters here are ... strong. The third floor was a riddle ghost, he got the riddle wrong. I'll wait here if you want to check it for yourself."</p>

          <p>"I think a powerful necromancer made these floors, an added layer of protection. All of the monsters are undead and old, maybe the necromancer is dead because they are weaker then they should be." With a flash a ball of white mana appeared in his hand. "I am a light mage, all things undead are weak to my magic." He looked down and squashed the light ball out of existence "Give me a moment to go see this ghost and if there is a way to get Linhart back. Wait here." With that he walked off down to the lower floor.</p>

          <p>In his absence I took a look around the room. A human skull on boney spider legs, serval of them lay around the room, as I turned I saw behind me the remains of a giant spider, it must of died a long time ago and was reanimated in this tower by the necromancer as Nymandus said. Now it lay dead in a pile to the right of the door I came in though, I wonder if it was already dead or if Nymandus really killed it himself.</p>

          <p>In the middle of the room coated in dust on a small stone pillar was a glass bottle, I blew on it and dust filled the air, rubbing the side gently I could see inside the glass bottle was a cloud, not just any cloud of gas but a cloud like you see in the sky, trapped inside a little bottle. As I rubbed more dust off I could see it was a little storm complete with sea water below also, this is interesting. I placed it inside my inventory for now.</p>

          <p>Nymandus soon came back, his face was unreadable. I felt like he had more experience then the others, they where all older then us but they acted no older at all as if their time at the academy had been shut in to dark rooms unaware of how quickly you can lose your life. Maybe sitting in dark rooms had sent them all mad.</p>

          <p>"So Linhart is gone. Did the ghost kill him? You said he fell."</p>

          <p>"He guessed the riddle wrong and although he was clearly pushed I didn't see what pushed him."</p>

          <p>Nymandus paused in thought for awhile before replying, "Well the ghost is banished now, it's a shame I did not make it in time. Any thoughts to what these extra trials are or why they where added on before the real entrance?"</p>

          <p>"Not a clue, I had no idea until you told me but I guess each era will add their own protection measures on top of the old, maybe that is why this place became so hard to break into."</p>

          <p>Nymandus thought for a while before nodding and taking me into the first room. The inside was a mess, a large skeleton made of of the bones of many species with serval skulls, bone spikes protruded out of its back and its legs where made of many bones almost like round cages instead of a single bone anywhere. If it ever had flesh it had long since gone. While it lay on the ground the stone floor had burn and slash marks all around even the room was not untouched. If it where not for the mage light Nymandus was casting the room would be been pitch black, since he said he spent the longest here I have to assume he killed this creature.</p>

          <p>We pushed though the last door and entered a long corridor at the end was large pillars with a portal in the middle. Since it was still active we stepped though. Waiting on the other side was the rest of the groups, at opposite ends of the room. Of course the first question we got asked was where is Linhart. "He will be catching up later, he went back to the camp to get potions he had a hard battle." Nymandus told the group. Although I held my poker face on the outside I was relived inside that he said something like that, if Ditwin found out he died I could only imagine his reaction.</p>

          <p>"Well, since Linhart has gone back I guess we should wait here for him or head on back as well" Ditwin replied to Nymandus.</p>

          <p>Nymandus thought for a moment before saying "I came to preform research on the undead, this place is a treasure trove of undead here, would be a shame to give up on even a day down here... Why don't you two stay just encase there are any treasures to be had. What with my concentration being on the ghosts and zombies who else could be left in charge of treasures."</p>

          <p>Ditwin agreed. "Can't leave treasures under the supervision of the younger students, they won't know what is good and what's not. Morons all of them. Can't be trusted."</p>

          <p>Nymandus just nodded. "Tisiel do you think this is the original entrance?"</p>

          <p>"Yeah... I am not sure what was here before, but the three separate areas we just traveled though seemed to be some kind of challenge at different levels. I am not sure it's purpose since they all lead to the same place. This seems to be an older structure I am not too sure if it's the original but it was defiantly here before the one we are in now."</p>

          <p>"We move forward then."</p>

          <p>"Wouldn't the entrance have protection on it?"</p>

          <p>Tisiel "Yes but it looks like either age or force have ruined it. Take a look these runes are broken and faded, even if the killing array or traps work since these are the detection runes none of them should activate. In Theory."</p>

          <p>"Since you say so, test out your theory." Ditwin sneered as he moved to block them from retreating away. Tisiel just responded by walking though the entrance way with confidence. After stepping though Tisiel added "Basic rune theory is taught as an optional class, maybe you should try it some time."</p>

          <p>We followed Tisiel's lead though the entrance way, along a bright marble white corridor lined with statues holding large weapons made of the same stone as themselves, they where not a similar style to the ones found in the pyramid but no doubt they had a similar function of protecting the inside from invaders. Luckily like the entrance way they seem to be inactive.</p>

          <p>At the far end where maybe a door should of been was just a large hole in the wall, it looked like it had been broken though and then tied up after but never replaced. Beyond that it became clear for the first time why this place had the reputation as a safe. With stone walls which must of been enchanted with magic and not made of any normal stone as although there where large blast marks and other evidence of battles taking place here not a single one was out of place and looked like they had not moved from the moment they had been placed.</p>

          <p>The walls spanned around the entrance in a semi-circle giving the intruders no place to go. After the first wall where more walls each progressively higher until the final layer which reached the roof of the cave. Turrets and platforms lined the walls breaking them apart into sections. There must of been more to it that we could not understand or magic we where unaware of but no doubt the academy would have a field day here.</p>

          <p>Just as I was spacing out & looking around at the breath taking sight Dipshit broke the silence. "Well that's just bloody great. How are we suppose to get inside!?"</p>

          <p>"Though the gate Ditwin" Nymandus replied in an almost bored tone as if this outing had turned into taking a child though a museum they had no interest in. Sure enough in the direction Nymandus was pointing was a large gate house in the first wall, at around 8m tall with thick square towers flanking either side of a gate way. The metal gate was not lowered and so we walked though, zig zagging our way up though each of the walled sections.</p>

          <p>After passing though without so much as a scratch from the abandoned defences the final wall with a tunnel like gate way which was 15m long in complete darkness opened into a room lit with dim fires around the perimeter. The moment Reingard step inside a slow clap came from the other end of the room. Clap. Clap. Clap. Followed by a voice like gritted sand " [Gibberish] "</p>

                    <!--  "Ah young apprentices you overcame the trials I set ... Hmmm wait no, that's wrong. W-What year is it? You do not look like [Mayan's] at all." -->

          <p>We all turned to look at Tisiel.</p>

          <p>"I've never heard their spoken language before... I have no idea what he said. Let me just.." With that she pulled out a skull from a bag at her waist and held it up. The reaction of the others was pure confusion but they said nothing.</p>

          <!-- skull = 5 civilizations including his own, then left in the study.

          <p>"[gibberish]" The skull said.</p>

            <!-- Not seen a Mayan myself for.. Who knows how long it has been. -->

            <p>As the skull spoke to the voice from the other side of the room we slowly approached, since Tisle started to walk forward as well, soon I could make out that there was a man sitting on a throne at the other end. The closer we got the more I could make out that this man had no eye balls, no skin. However he did have a few small muscles and ligaments along with his bones and clothes. While I am no expert and there is no way to tell right now how old this corpse is, it is truly remarkable that its condition is this good.</p>

            <p>"So that you all know, this gentleman here has been sitting here for longer then Alden has been a country, far longer. His was actually the last civilization before the one when I was sealed into that witches workshop. He is actually from the same people who built the pyramid although from a different faction, he worshiped a god of life while they worshiped a god of death. Ironic he became an undead I suppose..."</p>

            <p>Nymandus - "A god of life? What a great injustice he became an undead.. I would like to inquire about how such a thing would even happen. If he is willing I would be willing to purify him, if not well I will have to do it anyway."</p>

            <p>"Ah yes well I was getting to that, he does not know why it happened or how, it was actually one of the great mysteries of their end-times why so many undead came from this place but I think once we go deeper I will be able to help shed light on this. So please do send him on his way." With a simple nod Nymandus walked up to the undead man sat on the throne, their eyes or lack of in his case met and the undead mad nodded to him as Nymandus approached placed his hands on his head and gentle white light was released into his head. With that the man turned to dust.</p>

            <p>"Should we not of found out why he built that weird trial to get in here?"</p>

            <p>"Oh right, to test apprentice from his tribe, he was trying to find one with the talent to make it past this room. Their church of life I guess you could call it did not control this tomb at any point and only later arrived after the majority collapse of their civilization, those who did had already sealed themselves within."</p>

            <p>"Fuck all that, what are you!?" Gelfrat piped up.</p>

            <p>"Oh right, first time meeting I suppose. I was once a man and now I am a skull I suppose."</p>

            <p>"But I can sense you are not the same kind of undead he was. I don't understand." - Nymandus</p>

            <p>"Ah well I guess you would call me a sentient magic item, at least that is what I have come to learn so far but I have only been with you all for a short time.."</p>

            <p>The third years where all shocked. A sentient magic item. This is not something anyone could just have let alone so casually pull it out. Sentient items where so rare if the Grand duke of Alden even had a sentient item no one knew about it because he would never bring it out, let alone anyone of the other houses. The idea that this first year, and the weakest first year possible was walking around with a sentient item left their minds reeling.</p>

            <p>The first to move was Ditwin, as he strode forward Nymandus shouted "Stop!"</p>

            <p>"What do you mean stop!? That is worth millions!" Ditwin pointed to the skull in Tisiel's hands.</p>

            <p>"Yes, and its sentient. Do you even know what that means? Even if you did take it from her, the moment you get back to the academy it could just tell the deans it was sentient, and you had stolen it. Don't let your greed blind you."</p>

            <p>"And so what? What if I just store it and don't let it out."</p>

            <p>"You cannot store sentient items. That's why she had it in her bag. You are a research student Ditwin you should know this much at least. Even if you did want it, what made you think you would be the one to come out on-top if we all started fighting right now? We haven't fought before Ditwin, but I know your second year ranking and I know mine."</p>

            <p>"If I can't have it I wont be silent about you having it either Nymandus."</p>

            <p>"None of us could keep something like this to ourselves, we will turn it in for other rewards back at the academy. Even after we get rid of it the rumors that Tisiel had this in her possession..." He turned to Tisiel "People will hunt you to find where you got it."</p>

            <p>"I know, but had I not just now, we would all be dead. He had just found out he was an undead, any longer and he would of gone mad and killed us all, you should know this better then us Nymandus."</p>

            <p>"Yeah... We will just say we found it here. That might help a little.."</p>

            <p>With a sigh the skull continued "You all have a very basic understanding of sentient magic items but shall we first solve the biggest problem you have. With him gone the entrance you came though is naturally also gone, I am not sure what you will find if you go back but going forward won't be easy, have you not forgotten he spent many years here because he could not go forward. You know, to where all the treasure is."</p>

            <p>With the sudden reminder from the skull we had noticed that behind the throne was another tunnel, this one also dark but otherwise clean and clear. Gelfrat threw a rock down the tunnel. Thud. Thud. BANG. The rock was turned to dust from a large bolt of lighting out of one of the walls.</p>

            <p>"Otto you first" Gelfrat snickered to himself pointing at me.</p>

            <p>"How would that help?" I said back with a frown.</p>

            <p>"You're a lightning mage, it won't effect you."</p>

            <p>"That was heavenly lightning, pure white." Ditwin said with his mouth wide open.</p>

            <p>"You studied other elements?" Nymandus replied a bit shocked.</p>

            <p>"I study magical items, ranks, categories, uses and cost. Heavenly objects and how to recognize them is part of the course if only a short lecture as the chances of finding such high ranking items is impossible. Heavenly lightning would be a very clear indication." Ditwin</p>

            <p>"So what?" Gelfrat</p>

            <p>"Heavenly lightning is not like normal lightning, he would never survive on his own." Ditwin</p>

            <p>"What else we suppose to do then?" Gelfrat </p>

            <p>"Ahem." The skull said, since really it could not cough. "Yes while walking into that death trap is one option, since the undead are getting out of here somehow in the past there might be another entrance. Nymandus & Tisiel would be our best chance if we take a look around to start."</p>

            <p>Everyone started to look around at first, Gelfrat and Ditwin where the first to get bored and go back to throwing stones down the tunnel, in the hopes to find a path? Maybe I was giving them too much credit there. Tisiel took to reading the inscriptions around the room, some on pictures etched into the walls, others etched into the stone at the back of the throne. This is where Nymandus currently was looking down at the stone covered in writing. Reingard stood with Tisiel holding the skull as she wrote.</p>

            <p>Tisiel seemed to be having the time of her life, the writing was from the skulls era or so he said. I had to ask so I went over and showed the skull the coins we had found, sure enough they where also from his era. The coins had depictions on one side and symbols on the other. Roughly translated coins had 'Death', 'Seal', & 'Time'. On the flip side the depictions, first the coin from the pyramid had an alter with a man ripping out a heart, this was also where I found the coin inside the pyramid on an alter, the people who had this coin last must of tried to recreate the image on the back. The coin from the king's tomb we dubbed the daughters coin had **** on the back, and finally the coin from the strange man I found in the forest. </p>

          <h4>Shrine Date</h4>
          <!-- Mask -->
          <p>I took out the mask I had gotten from Leon back when I last visited him, we had no clue about what it was or used for but I figured I'd give a shot asking since it looks like a Leikan design. I held it out in two hands and asked, "Do you know what this is? I don't. It was a gift from a friend.."</p>

          <p>She looked back at the mask then laughed a little, "You must have an interesting friend to give you a gift like this, it is a shrine mask. we wear them during festivals and special days when we visit the shrines. There are two kinds, ceremonial and godly. Once you have a god you wish to follow, you take the mask to a shine and get it blessed by the god. If the shrine is a shrine to that god that would be better, but it is not necessary. The god will bless the mask, similar to religious jewelry here in Alden."</p>

          <p>"Oh, then does this belong to someone already?"</p>

          <p>"If it did it does not now, there is no spirit mark on this mask." She held out a white and red mask, it had the face of a tiger but it was quite cute and would only cover the top half of a face. "This is my mask, if you let your mana feel the mask you can see that my mana is infused with the mask, this is a kind of mark to bind the mask to me."</p>

          <p>I passed my mana over the mask and could feel the familiar mana of Tsuma coming from inside the mask. I had to ask "would I be able to bind with this mask?"</p>

          <p>"Is that what you want? Once bound it would be very difficult to break that connection with the god."</p>

          <p>"I can have a connection to more then one God right?"</p>

          <p>She gently placed the tiger mask in her hand onto her face, no straps where needed it gently fit into place as if it was made to fit, "If other Alden's heard what you just said they would be very shocked.." She walked towards the shine and I followed mask in hand. "It is not possible to receive the faith spells from more then one God. However.. It is possible to make a connection to more then one God and wear and receive benefits from the items of other Gods.." With a small smile she lead me to the front of the shrine.</p>

          <!-- Byakko, autumn, west metal, lightning (our book) -->
          <!-- white stag,  -->
          <p>"The stag mask you have represents one of the gods of lightning. The white stag is from one of the local religions, Chingaling I believe. they have a similar religion to us, Alden puts Chingaling, Huonhia and Leika's religions into the same category." Pointing to the white tiger mask she has on her face and says "This mask also represents a God of lightning, Byakko, he is the lord of season of autumn, the west and metal. What is import for us though is that both will be Gods of lightning!"</p>

          <p>I could not help but let out a small laugh and smile, seeing that we would be bound in this small way gave me a feeling of butterflies in the pit of my stomach. To make a connection though the mask I had to produce a drop of my blood and place it inside of the mask where the mask would touch my face, place it on the alter inside the shrine and make an ernest attempt to connect to the white stag God. If all went well the god would bless the mask and it would become a magical item, then I could fill the mask with my mana and bind it to myself.</p>

          <!-- god reply? -->

          <p>I picked up the mask and scanned it with my mana, I was told white stag mask would increase my magic by {0.4 x level} points or something equivalent, if I had a suitable lightning type power then the mask might be blessed with a lightning blessing. Either way the item would be a common item and the description name would be blue.</p>

          <li>Head:<font color="blue"> Ceremonial White Stag Mask.</font> Magic: +4.</li>

          <p>When I scanned my mask what I saw was surprising, it must have something to do with the new class I acquired because the mask was not even close to the expected.</p>

          <li>Head:<font color="purple"> Heavenly White Stag Mask.</font> Magic: +4.</li>

          <p>"You said there were two types of masks?"</p>

          <p>"Oh, yeah the second type is not a kind of mask you will be able to get, it is a heavenly mask, this kind of mask there is only one of in the world and contains the will of that God. These masks are held in the main shrine in Otsu the capital city of Leika."</p>
