          <p>Charia Jun 12 21-12, GrandDuchy of Alden. Near the village of Steinauhau, 24km from the nearest neighbour village of Sweausern. A rebellion is being hosted in the neighbouring provence of Heilerbach. The GrandDuchy of Alden is home to 3.2 million people and about 58km. Making it the 2nd smallest state on the continent of Charia. Steinauhau is a small village with an urban population of 1700 people and rural population of 9300 people. It sits in a temperate forest near the sea, in the northern area of the continent.</p>
          
          <h2>0-14</h2>
          <h3>Steinauhau</h3>

            <!-- Starting with the setting up of the place? and events. -->
          <p>"Congratulations!" A unified cheer rang out around the town hall, looking down into his cup David lamented, the reflection looking back at him is far older then it use to be, stiff and past the age where he should be drinking luminescent green drinks, but he had always liked melon pop from his first taste over 70 years ago now. Soon the reflection in the cup smiles back. "You look happier then you have in years" his thoughts interrupted David turns to see his old friend Edmure. "I was just thinking about how new life replaces the old" he continues to smile. With a frown and then a small smile Edmure retorts "You thinking Michkels new babe is here to replace you?, there is still life left in the both of us yet". The small gathering carries on into the night. June 12th a night the people of Alden celebrate the new life brought into this world over the past year, a small tradition as not all make it past infancy.</p>

          <h3>Play day</h3>
            <!-- starting with the kids meeting as friends, introduce the town, some news the people, small parts of the world, culture-->
          <p>"Hey Karla" Michkel waves across the village square towards a tall woman holding hands with 3 children. Two older girls and a boy, all the children had red hair like their mother. As the two groups get closer Michkel nudges Sarah his wife and points to his son's smiling face, they smile to each other. "Good to see you are all well" Sarah say's towards Karla and bends down to smile at the children. "Where is Robert?" chimes Michkel. "He's going to meet us later on, went to the hall to get the news and left me alone with these loverly lot" Karla replies. The now larger group makes their way towards a near by wood, where they meet with other adults of the village and their children, the group of children run off into the forest to play as the adults make way for a fire, today is a festive day June 12th.</p>

          <!-- Children in the forest -->
         <p>The group of 7 laughing running into the forest, beyond the eyes of their parents, they arrive at a circular clear area within the small wooded area they often play. Eugen 13 years of age, larger, and taller then the others of the group, but without a temper or ambition he plays with children younger then him rarther then the older children of the village. Beke, 12 a slow child, but easily angered. Ilse 12, the oldest child of Sarah and Robert. Effi 10 the younger sister of Ilse. Otto 10 the oldest son of Michkel and Karla, with two younger brothers, and a sister on the way. Nils 10 the 8th child of the village leader, although only 5 remain. Jakob 9, A small boy, shy and ungifted.</p>

         <!-- <p>The children are armed with wood swords, shields, spears and staves. Today like most days they pretend to be heroes from old stories, facing off in small 1v1's with little orgnisation or any teams at all. After settling their small disputes and deciding who gets to be which hero they turn to battle their foe as a team. Under the command of Ilse, who while not the oldest child was Eugen had to little ambition to even lead a group as small as this and Beke who's temper is too hot to make any meaningful decisions. They charge in and out fighting a tree with a 'monster' draw onto the side.</p> -->

         <!-- What about adding the children arguing instead of jsut saying they did? -->
        
        <p>"I want to be a fighter today!"</p>
        <p>"Do you even know what fighters do? I heared your parents where farmers"</p>
        <p>"Ofcouse I know! We all went to lessons, they move the mana inside them to where it is needed to become faster or stronger" Otto replies happy with himself </p>
        <p> "You cant be a fighter, you don't have a sword, bow or anything at all! you have to be a mage, unless you want to be a rouge.." Beke snickers.</p>
        <p> Otto picks up a stick and swings it about like a sword</p>
        <p>"ahahaha" Beke burts into laughter</p>
        <p>"It's a wand. I was just testing it."</p>
        <p>"You two stop arguing and get into posistion the monster is here!" Ilse points to a tree with a monster draw onto it's side..</p>
        <p>
        That is how the team ended up with 4 melee fighters, 2 ranged fighters and 1 mage</p>
         
         <p>"Charge!" <br> "Heavy blow!" <br>  "Battle shout!" <br> "Provoke" </p>
         <p>The sounds of the fight ring out though the small clearing. "Hig-h Impact!!", "Fire Ball!". "fire ball? That's not a junior skill thats imtermediate. We all agreed to start at junior level." Berk grows towards the smaller Otto. "I thought we must of leveled up by now!" retorts Otto. "Why would we level up it's not even dead yet!" Berk shouts back. "come on now, we can't get distracted in a fight! Otto must of just got tired of being the mage every time" Ilse steps in to redirect Berks attention. "He's the mage because he cannot afford a real weapon, that is not even a wand it's just a stick" Beke spits out. Otto looks down at the stick in his hand, true enough it was no real wand. "that's what wands are, just sticks, now kill that monster!" Isle points towards the tree and Beke runs up and slams his shield into the tree and stabs it with his sword point before triumptly shouting that he had slain the monster.</p>
         <!-- The play introduces the reader in to what happens in the world, and monsters -->

          <!-- play comes to an end, the festivities start -->
          <p>As the sun reaches the middle of the sky the group run back from the forest at the smell of food, they soon catch the lights of the large fire and the food being passed around the smaller children and the adults. They pick up the pace and run over to join in the festivities.</p>

          <!-- They continue their days with the adults working, the children play or help out -->
          <!-- news could be brought back from the town hall by Robert -->
            <p>Charia Jun 12 21-22, The GrandDuchy shares a large boarder with the Principality of Huonhia to the south-east, a small boarder with the Principality of Leikia to the South. A mostly abandoned boarder with the Kingdom of Hatalisa to the west. The kingdom has recently made peace with the Pocotocotcan Theocracy, after joining forces with Leikia, Chalbia & the Mifuegan League off far to the west, the peace led Pocotcotcan to give lands to the Empire, including the trading town of Tlapatan.</p> 
                     
            <p> To the North they share another large boarder with the Heilerbach Republic, along this boarder on the Republics side has growing unrest. Due to their neighbours attention being focused west, or internally the GrandDuchy has had relative pace thoughout the past decade.</p>
            <!-- around the year 21-22 the rebelion breaks out -->

            <h3>Incident</h3>
          <!-- the incident -- re-do, the reader leaves knowing the world is not easy, the game style world they live in, charter skeletons they take with them. -->
          <p>The group are playing deep inside the forest when one of them discovers lurking near by is a leaf green figure, with a large yellow eye, webbed hands and feet with black sharp nails attached, a small belly and a slight hunchback. Its mouth shaped like bird beak but with small teeth protruding up from below. One of them shouts "monster detected!" and all the children scramble towards the creature in a charge. Unaware of the dangers of reality.</p>

          <p>Ilse shouts commands at the others to form up, and attack, ordering Otto to cast a protection spell on the Eugen, Effi to stand and protect her as she gives commands, Jakob and Nils to use their bows and for Beke Eugen to run forth and provoke the creature.</p>

          <p>At first the young Kappa is supprised and taken back by the sundden attacks and loud shouting, the children are spured on by their advantage and Beke slams his shield into the creature and stabs at its ribs with his wooden sword shouting "shield bash" with great joy. Eugen follows up by stabbing into the creature with his spear, the tip is dull but with enough force to pierce though the creatures skin, a long high screech sounds out in the clearing, confident Eugen tries to thrust further in but is unable. A toy arrow lands at Jakob's feet, Nils off into the distance. A child's cry fills the air, Eugen balled over on the ground holding his face as blood drips from it, in the struggle to pull his spear back the young kappa had slashed across his face in its panic.</p>

          <p>Ilse dashes froward to help, as Beke in his panic and anger curses Otto, "You where told to cast protection why didn't you cast protection!" Otto knowing this is no longer part of any game despratly wishes he could of done anything at all to help, drops his wand. The young kappa no sooner had slashed the boys face free'd himself of the spear jumps on his back and stabs his webbed claws into his his neck. Blood sqeeses out of the holes and around his sharp claws, Ilse runs up to the pair and tries to pull the creature off. Beke standing before his friend screaming in pain, starts hitting the creature with his sword and stabbing at his eyes, soon the creature lets out a screech as he jumps off Eugen, who is now silent on the ground in a pool of his own blood.</p>

          <p>Effi who was suppose to be protecting her older sister had been stood still in the shock of it all, suddenly spung to life and jumped into the frey, the 3 children, Ilse, Beke & Effi beat on the monster with their swords defending with shields. The monster now hidden from view of Otto muttering magic spells he heard of from stories and Jakob collecting a few rocks from the ground, while Nils throws them at the monster where he can.</p>

          <p>In the short frenzy the creature knocks Effi aside, and makes a break for it running towards the tree line, the children give chase, Jakob bending down to pick a rock is slamed into by a fleeing monster who rips at Jakobs face and sides pulling out chunks of flesh and blood from the screaming child. The others more panicied scream and run towards the monster and Jakob Beke first, larger and stronger then the others who pushes the monster off Jakob only to recieve quick swipes towards his shield, Ilse dives in and punges her sword into the creatures left eye, it oozes out black liquid as the creature lets out a loud scream and plunges his claws into Ilse's stomach.</p>

          <p>Effi arriving later then her stronger faster comrads pushes her shield between Ilse and the creature who with his weight alone pushes them to the ground, Effi holds the shield between them trying to protect her older sister as the creature strikes down a blinding flash of light appears near the creatures one good eye and blinds it. "Heavy strike" Beke shouts as he slams his sword over the creatures head, as the creature spins and swipes its claws randomly Effi shouts "Prevoke" and feels the creature attention directly on her, dispite it being unable to see. It charges, as the creature arrives onto Effi's shield again, Ilse plunges her little toy sword into the creature's wound and its heart stops from the impact, the creature falls to the ground beathing heavily as Beke smashes his sword over its head again. It die's from blood loss shortly after.</p>

          <p>The whole encounter took just a few moments, even though to the group it felt a long time. Two of their friends lay dead in their own blood, Nils kneels by Jakobs body shivering unable to bring himself to move or speak. Beke shouts out for all to hear, blaming all of the others, until his eyes land on Eugen only then does he break, seeing his friends managled and shreaded face. Effi holds her older sister in her arms, repeating over and over that mother will be here soon, it will be okay. Ilse dies looking back at Effi unable to speak, lungs full of blood.</p>

          <p>"Level up!" the words cover Otto's vision.</p>

          <p>Soon the adults who had long heard the unusual screams come running into the clearing, shocked at the scene before them, quickly checking to the children and the monsters body.</p>

          <p>"You know what kind of creature this is?" Edmure asks. "Yeah, a Kappa, a young one at that, less then 2 years old." replies David. Edmure looks towards him and David continues. "Not native to here ofcourse I've never seen one this far south, or this far from a river, they rarely leave the waters only to snach prey or children who wonder off alone. But never this far and never before they reach adulthood."</p>
          <p>The duo stand watching the body burn. "Scouting turned up nothing, maybe it really did get driven south by the events in the north, there were no traces of other kappas in the area. That being said I have had reports of increasing monster attacks from Swexausern."</p>

          <h3>Aftermath</h3>
          <!-- punishment -->

          <h4>Otto POV</h4>
          <!-- a reflection for some of the others maybe about the deaths? monsters? -->
          <p>Sitting alone in his room later that night he could not help but reflect back on what was told to him earlier. The numbers displayed infront of him right now where his stats, he could even see his class, the spells he could learn in the future and last of all his level, 1.</p>

          <p class="stats">
            <li>Name: Otto.</li>
            <li>Level: 1.</li>
            <li>Primary Class: Mage.</li>
            <li>Spells: 1.</li>
            <li>Titles: 0.</li>
            <li>Spell points: 0.</li>
            <li>Stat points: 2.</li>
            <li>Stats:</li>
            <li>Strength: 0</li>
            <li>Vitality: 0</li>
            <li>Defence: 0</li>
            <li>Magic: 0</li>
            <li>MDef: 0</li>
            <li>Dexterity: 0</li>
            <li>Sense: 1</li>
            <li>Charisma: 2</li>
          </p>

          <p>He was told not to spend any of the points or learn any spells yet, that he was going to be sent to the village hall tomorrow to be tested for his aptitude and when he was 14 he would go to the magic acadamey in Banderdam.</p>

          <p>Almost all the stats where 0 however, this could not be good. Thinking at first there was a mistake he asked his parents but he soon learned that these numbers are a display of how much the mana can affect him and his spells, them being 0 just means that his mana flow to these areas is poor. The mana would not contribute toward anything he tried to do.</p>

          <p>All children growing up are told stories of heros and vilans, magic, monsters, and great warriors. But nothing was ever said about how to unlock their class, skills, or stats. Almost like everyone who had unlocked them was sworn to silence, today he found out that was true. For their own protection as the only way to unlock stats was to slay a monster in battle without the help of anyone with stats, knowing this some children might carelessly try and fight a monster before they where 14. Naturally not everyone kept the secret and most children had killed a monster before they where 14 just usually just one their parent had picked out for them, something less dangerous.</p>

          <h4>Beke POV</h4>
          <p>Beke outside the village hall, looking around he could see some of the children he use to play with, the older children of the area. They pay little or no attention to Beke as he comes into the hall they instead are deep into their studies or prataice.</p>

          <p>He makes his way past the children on the right praticing with swords, spears & shields. To the left children pratice copying the movements of different animals, boars, snakes, dogs, cats even rats. A look of rejection comes across Bekes face to these children doing odd movements. He arrives are the large wooden doors to the hall, *describe the hall* He makes his way inside, seeing children sitting around reading, silently, taking notes, the atmosphere in here around these children made Beke feel unconftable, not his kind of thing. Soon he finds himself stood infront of an elderly man with grey hair, a long nose, long wrinkly fingers, the old man was wearing a thick woolen cloak. Even Beke knew better then to intrupt this particular man.</p>

          <p>After a few moments the mans voice booms out "Late".</p>
          <p>"S-sorry Mr. David I had to clean as punishment for.." his eyes drift off and memories of the incident start to come back, but before he could clearly remeber.. </p>
            
          <p> "I don't want your excuses, do your cleaning then run here tomorrow. Now let's see what your apptitude is, place your hand on here, quickly now."</p>

          <p>"apptitude?" before he can talk any more his hand is dragged over a small rock, it looks like the ocean it's self is stored inside the rock, the reflection never sitting still. Soon after his hand is placed on the rock it turns to a light sea green. "Well, was not expecting that, maybe I judged you too quickly." Beke looks up confused at his statement "Sorry?"</p>

          <p>"Expected you to be a Fighter, seems you are a Rouge"</p>

          <p>"No, no, that can't be I must be a fighter, my brothers are fighters, my farther my mother, my whole family are all fighters!"</p>

          <p>"That is not how this works, Rouges are outside today, on your right as you leave, can't miss them." David goes back to his paper work. Beke looks on for a moment before realising he has been dismissed there is no arguing, he puts on foot infront of the other walking back to the door he came in from thinking over and over, no, it has to be wrong.</p>

          <p>Beke makes his way over to the Rogue group, the children around him are still moving in weird ways. The adult teaching them walks over to Beke. "So you are a Rogue then? Best to see what kind."</p>

          <p>"What kind?" Beke looks around. "Like what animal I am?"</p>

          <p>"Ahahaha, no, no. Don't know much about Rogues do you? Alright let's start from the begining"</p>

          <!-- Shit about rouges -->
          <h3>Training</h3>
          <p>While the other children trained and praticed Beke was taken to one side and asked what he knew.</p>

          <p>"So Beke why did you want to be a Fighter?"</p>

          <p>"My whole family are Fighters, I would of been a really good fighter, I am stronger and larger then the others my age."</p>

          <p>hmm I do see your point, but let me clear some things up. Firstly Rogues are not Fighters who mimic animal moves, anyone can do that. If someone want to fight while acting like a monkey or a snake that is up to them but that is not exsactly what is going on here. You see Fighters move mana thoughout their bodies to increase their speed, strength or even defend from attacks this much you might already know from your parents. A Rogue however uses their mana to repoduce how monsters fight. It's not so much about the movements but how they use their mana, let me show you.</p>

          <p>No sooner had he stopped talking a large black tail, as long as his own body had appeared behind him and slamed into the ground, the ground fell and gave way to its quick and powerful strike. "Scorpian tail, that is my spirit."</p>

          <p>"So I can grow extra body parts, parts of monsters to help me fight!?"</p>

          <p>"Aha well yes" he gesters towards his own tail. "However also no. It is not about having extra body parts, although you can, I've even seen a man who repalced his eyes with that of a bird of prey, made him an amazing archer. The point is being a Rouge is about taking what advantages a monster has and making them or own. From level 1 though to 10 we mimic the monster we want to steal from, learn how they fight so that we can kill them, eat their heart and take their spirit for our own."</p>

          <p>"Eat their heart? gain their spirit? Are you saying if I eat the heart of a dragon I can grow wings and breathe fire?"</p>

          <p>"Maybe, I never known anyone who bested a dragon in single combat and then ate the dragons heart, so what ablities and skills can be learned from a dragon I do not know. But I do know you should not pick a dragon as your first target."</p>

          <p>"I don't think a dog or a cat would suit me."</p>

          <p>"You are right about that, like you said you are big and strong, since you are later then your class mates to level you will not reach level 10 as quickly as them, prehaps you should aim a little higher, something that suits you."</p>

          <p>Beke for once in his life, stops, takes pause and thinks about what would suit him.</p>

          <p>"You don't have to decide right this second you know, there are records of other Rouges you could see what abilities they got before you decide. For today since you came with your sword and shield, let us train basic fighting."</p>

          <p>With a nod Beke agrees and joins the group.</p>
          <h4>Effi POV</h4>

          <p>So Strenght increase the physical damage you do, and magic how much magical damage you do. Vitality how long you can survive, this includes resistance to poisons. Magic defence, and defence are fairy self explaotory. Dexterity affects your speed, reaction time, how precice you are, thoes sort of things. Sense is not just detecting traps but senseing someones mood and many other things and finally your charisma or charm i've heard it called both but it affacts how amuable people are towards you.</p>

          <h4>Beke POV</h4>
          <!-- Lunch and disscussion of the others  -->
          <p>After tranining with the others in the Rogue group, Beke started to like it, although his level was lower he was popular with the others who wanted to train against a new opponent and made a few new friends.</p>
          <p>Beke places his lunch try down and looks around at his group of Rogues, the Fighters sitting on other tables. "So where did Nils end up, as a mage?"</p>
          <p>"Oh, no he is praticing to be an artist, I hear he's going to go to the Capital to train"</p>
          <p>"Oh, what about Effi?" Beke says with a little disgust.</p>
          <p>"The stone turned red for her, Fighter"</p>
          <p>"A Fighter!? How could a coward like that become a Fighter?"</p>
          <p>Silence filled the table. "What about Otto, did he even turn up?"</p>
          <p>"... Purple, mage."</p>
          <p>"Ha! He couldn't cast a spell even WHEN his life depended on it"</p>
          <p>More silence.</p>

          <!-- Lessons -->
          <h4>Skill tree lesson - Otto</h4>
          <p>After being directed away by an old man behind a desk I was facing a room of other children like me sitting on the floor off to the side of the main entrance. There was about 14 like me in total and a tall skinny man at the front, his boney hand gestured for me to sit down anywhere. As soon as I had he carried on speaking as if I had always been here.</p>

          <p>"If you remember from earlier Luis told us that when you unlock your first level, you will have access to your skill trees. These trees are where you can spend your skill points to acquire new abilities or just improve your current abilities."</p>

          <p>"You all have 2 skill trees right now. Your class, for you all sitting here today that is Mage. If you put points into this skill tree you will increase the amount of mana you have, learn magic spells and other wondrous things. Your second tree is your race, for everyone here today that is clearly Human. For other races such as elves from the Mifuegan League and naga from the empire, their race tree will not be human but of their own race."</p>

          <p>"Today we will be looking at the Human skill tree. This skill tree is often overlooked by not only combat focused people but also other races. While other races might get direct combat related skills and buffs the human skill tree is mostly focused around the charisma stat. This is the most overlooked stat in my opinion but you can make up your own mind."</p>

          <p>Over the course of the day we made notes and learned about the various skills and advantages and of course the disadvantages the human skill tree. The overall gist being that the human skill tree made humans appear more trustworthy, liked and various boots while in a party. This made humans particularly in large numbers, and political environments.</p>

      <h3>Arrival</h3>
      <!-- <p>first year of military school, need some parts about the travel above? </p> -->
      <p>Effi and her small group arrive on the outskirts of Grafen, this city has no castle instead hosting a military training camp to the north of the city. The city itself was the crossing point for the main route for trade traveling from the south of Alden to the north. It sat across the Norbadsu river which led from the West to the North. The city had walls, a large market place and a shanty town built up in the shadow of the side of the Southern wall. Grafen was inside the province of Lormersia which was the seat of Duke Reinhold of House Graf, a house that has long been counts and other forms of noblity though the ages. With a population of almost 12,000 it was the largest town in the province.</p>

      <p>The group would get oppertunity to explore the town during their two year stay here but they would infact be staying at the camp just outside of the town. Arriving at the gates to the camp they are stoped by guards before checking their belongings, papers and identies. After which they made their way into the encampment towards the paved square in the middle of the camp which was overlooked by a stone building which appeared to be a small palace. The plaza was filled with sevral groups of new recruits making 8 lines quing to older looking men sat behind wooden creats they used as desks.</p>

      <p>When it was Effi's turn she approached the desk she could see there was a mana stone on the desk just like the one back in the village hall, scrolls of paper and ink pots and keys. The man asked her to put her hand over the manastone, it glowed red as expected, he took her name, age & where she was from. He then handed her a scroll and a key. "Read it carefully, if you cannot read I will read it to you and then sign the bottom with your blood." Effi read though the doccument, it was as expeted a contract to join the military academy as a fighter with what was expected of her and what would be provided to her all layed out. She pricked her palm and driped the blood onto the scroll which gave off a faint light. The man took back the scroll and stored it in a crate he had behind him and handed Effi a copy. "It's not important that you keep it unless you are unsure if we are treating you baddly, in which case you will need to to refer to." She folded it neatly and placed it inside her inside pocket. She gave a quick bow to the man behind the desk who dismissed her and she went to find 'IIG1' the place she was allocated.</p>

      -->
      <p>Arriving at the halls, she could see rectable wooden buildings layed out before her. 3 floors tall, not very wide but at least 5 rooms long. In the middle was a swimming pool sized grass area, with 3 buildings either side and 2 top and bottom for a total of 10 halls.</p> 
      
      <p>In the middle of the area surrounded by the buildings was a flag pole and adorning the top was a square flag with deep red background, same as the color of the manastone turns for fighters and a silver "II". Thinking to herself that this must be area II she decideds to just walk from building to building until she finds G.</p>

      <p>G was on the left side in the middle, they where in alphabetical order starting from the right handside making its way around clockwise. She firstly knocks on the door and waits and a short reply comes back though the door". "It's open you don't have to knock, you live here now" came a very confident yet not overly loud voice from beyond the door.</p>

      <p>Feeling abit embrassed Effi pushed open the door and looked around, when coming in she could see shoe shelves left and right of her, some shoes next to tags with the room numbers written on them. She found her own and put her boots and decided to leave her boots on the floor as they where quite muddy. Stepping up past he shoe racks to the left was a kitchen area and to the right was a seating area with a fireplace, although no fire was lit. Sitting inside was a boy of the same age. Very stright black hair, long ontop and spikes up towards the right, back and sides cut short pointing down. He was leading back into a chair legs crossed infrount of him without much of a care to anything. Wearing loose wollen top and tight brown leather trousers with a metal discs attached from the belt loop at the frount around and up to the belt look at the back. He had no shoes on which seem to be the house rule, bright yellow eyes, Effi had never seen another person with yellow eyes before and got very distracted by them.</p>

      <p>"If you are done staring.. allowed me to introduce myself."</p>

      <p>"I wasen't.."</p>

      <p>"Please, it's not my first time, my eyes are rare after all. Let's not lie to each other we are going to be fighting togeather soon." he stands and bows. "I am Naoki, and no I am not from Leikia but my parents were. My role in the party is "DPS", a damage dealer."</p>

      <p> "Ah, I am Effi, I come from Steinauhau, I am going to be a tank. But how do you know we are going to be in the same party?"</p>
     
      <p> "Well there is two groups of 5 if you want to look at it that way but in the military and this academy a unit is made of 10, 5 would just be a squad. As you might of noticed there are 10 houses in II company and as you might guess 10 units makes 1 company."</p>

      <p>"Is there anything else I should know?"</p>
      
      <p>"Oh right, I mean all the military stuff I was just reading off the posters painted onto the walls" he points to large posters painted directly on the cream colored walls each with information. "They put it up so we don't forget. Appart from that I also just arrived 2 days ago, so if you like I can show you around."</p>

      <div class="pop">Poster<img height="500px" class="popOut" src="./images/ranks.png" alt="Ranks"></div>

      <p>Effi looks at a poster about the ranks in the military then turns to Naoki and says "Please I just arrived and really want to get the dirt off myself."</p>

      <!-- layout of the camp -->
      <!-- <p>There is 8km between the main road north and the end of the province boarder where the river bends north.</p> -->
      <h4> - Change of Pov to Naoki - </h4>
      <p>"So the base is home to serval companies starting with I, II, III, IV... and so on. The layout of each of these for both the first and secound years is the same so I think we can skip visiting them all."</p>

      <p>"There are store houses, armorys and stables and just areas to store things in gernal under the walls, the archer ramparts above them. In the middle is the officers quaters, main armory and parade square. The buildings in that area are all for offerices even the pub so don't even think about joining them."</p>

      <p>"ohh do we get our on pub?"</p>

      <p>"Aha, no, unfortunatly not. We doo get some relaxtion, you may thank Leikia for the bathhouses that can be found on the south side, although there are no hot springs there is a suna and warm baths to be found."</p>

      <p>"Ah I can't wait to try them, we never had a sauna or bathhouse in Steinauhau, but why must I thank the people of Leikia?"</p>

      <p>"Well it is not appart of the normal culture here in Alden but for the people of Leikia it is intergral to their everyday lives. Now the reason we have one here is because officers of Alden who spent time in Leikia training their officers liked them so much."</p>

      <p>"I see. Well either way I cannot wait to try them" Effi gesters to her dirty attire</p>

      <p>"Aha, well yes that is why I am taking you there, I won't be joining you ofcouse the bathhouses are split by gender so get thoes thoughts out of your head. I trust you remeber the way back."</p>

      <p>Red faced Effie replies "I was thinking no such thing!"</p>

      <p>Naoki just smiles. "Well there is a small libuary if you are intrested in reading nothing but military writings. Other then that everything 'fun' is inside the city of Graf."</p>

      <p>"Do you think we will get much time off?"</p>

      <p>"3 days a month, which day depends on your secdual. If you finish in the top 10% of that month you get an extra day off. Although the examinion types change each month so it is unlikely you'll place highly every month."</p>

      <p>Effi makes a compentative face showing her dertermination to be the best. At the sight of this Naoki just rolls his eyes.</p>

      <p>"And here we are." Naoki gesters towards a wooden building intrupting the normal layout of the camp, where another companies area should of been was the bathhouses.</p>

      <p>"Thank you for showing me around" Effi bows</p>

      <p>"I did not really show you around, although I did plan on it all I did was take you stright to the bathhouse. I could smell you coming before you even knocked."</p>

      <p>Effi with a red face "Hey! It was a long journey here." Naoki just smiles and waves as he walks away.</p>

      <h3>Training</h3>
      <h4>POV Effi</h4>
      <p>As secduled, the relaxed atomsphere all ended on the first day of training. The officers had made their way back from protecting new recruits on the road to the camp, along with the secound years from missions they had been sent on during the start of June.</p>

      <p>Effi and troop where lined up in the parade ground in room order. There where to the left and right of them units from the same company, across the square where other companies all first years all with an officer standing before them. Stood above them all looking out over them a small wooden platform had been assesmbled infrount of the stone building. Upon it was the commander officer for this training regiment.</p>

      <p>His voice rang out around the parade sqaure. "Speach"</p>

    <!-- Monthly assessments in different areas -->
    <!-- Physical, magical defence, physical damage, tatical command, knolwedge, party, unit, stamnia, total defence, duels, scouting, logistics, swimming, rowing, sea battles, capture the flag -->

    <p>Company II where sent to one of the training fields around the camp. They line up all faceing foward towards the officer of their company. He was an aged man, with short grey hair, a well trimmed grey beard a heavy stare but his face still seemed friendly. He had a mix of hardened leather armor with metal plates on his elbows and under his sholder guards. Attached to his left hip was an officers single handed sword. The blade looked to be about 80cm (32 inches).</p>

    <h4>POV Change to Friedrich</h4>

    <p>"Welcome to company II. I am Friedrich Odeck, from the province of Odeck. I will be your company commander for the next 2 years. You will be taught by myself and other officers thoughout the years but I will be in charge of your wellbeing, cleanliness and dicplin"</p>
    
    <p>"I trust you have all had time to bathe, before changing into the kit provided. I see no one was foolish enough this year to turn up dressed in anything else." As I said so I was looking over the students, while most thought it was to size them up it was really to try and match their faces to the description given on the paper.Every year I would dread getting a new company, learning all their faces, personalites, names. I often wished I was like the other officers who either did not bother or called them all by the same name, but that is not my style.</p>

    <p>"Which nicely brings us to the most important part of today, the rules. They will help keep you safe, not just from accidents but also from being punished." Switching the paper from the bottom to the top to remind me of the camp rules.</p>

    <p>"During your time on duty you are to remain in the uniforms provided. This means that even when you are no longer training and just walking to the bathhouse, meeting a friend in the plaza or even in your own houses you are to wear the causal uniform provided, and when you are expected to be training with an officer you will wear the formal uniform provided. If this makes sense nod your heads in agreement." Watching the students nod I can't help but thick back to the mistakes I made my first time teaching by asking them if they understood, a mistake to be sure all I would get back is random replies and questions.</p>

    <p>"You cannot leave the camp walls without permission, this includes on your off days. If you want to leave the camp on your days off you must be signed out by an officer. For your days off to make things smoother I sign them before hand so you can collect them without disturbing me, and for thoes who are a pain I make sure to burn their slip in the fire." It's good to let them know their are concaquences, but also to follow up on them, this one is easy to remeber.</p>

    <p>"Lastly, no fighting outside of training, follow officers orders when given and clean up any mess you see, if it is your own or not. If you disagree with any of these rules or break them the reprocutions are as follows."</p>

    <p>"first a verbal warning, or gester from an officer. If you miss this warning thats your problem. Secound a verbal in your face warning, you won't miss this one and it will come with a duty you have to proform, cleaning something usually. Finally removal from the area, if you refuse to remove your self the officer *** in charge of camp behavior, or his goons will come and remove you by force. You're welcome to fight them provided you are seeking a painful and twisted death." I think I will get BBQ tonight, fed up of stew and bread.</p>

    <p>"To add to this I have my own rules. Often you hear your eldars say things like quite, which means to talk quietly. When really they want you to be silent. I will say silence when I want silence and there shall be no confusion." Roast chicken does sound good though.</p>

    <p>"When refering to officers you may call me Officer Odeck, not Friedrich. You maybe also call me Sir or Officer. If it is another officer you do not know the name off stick to Sir, Madam or Officer" I've decided it's going to be chicken.</p>

    <p>"Finally, and most importantly, don't have sex with each other, when you break up it will make everything awkuard. You have to fight as a unit together for another 2 years."</p>

    <p>"If you have questions or anything to say, raise your hand and wait silently to be called on, if not remain standing and silent." </p>

    <p>A hand goes up from F house. "Present yourself, state your name, rank and question" a student steps forward, average looking student really. Dark brown hair, brown eyes little on the skinny side.</p>

    <p>"Sigmand sir, Levi sir, So if we break the rules and get taken away, what happens to us?"</p>

    <p>Friedrich raises an eye brow and waits for the student to add "Sir" to the end of that question then replies. "Honestly, I am not too sure. Depends on what you did really. From my side all I see is that you come back ready to participate and follow orders, if it takes a week or a month or not at all, that's on you really." Well it's not a lie, I am not 100% sure in every case, they just take them to a holding area sit them against a wall and ram the desk up to them so they cannot move and are forced to work there, unless they are violent, may the god have mercy on the violent ones.</p>

    <p>Another hand goes up. "Step forth." "Hannah Sir, Levi Sir, What if we are concidently told off but not taken away? Sir"</p>

    <p>"Why? you planning on being a pain Hannah? You have a meeting with me, if that fails a meeting with my superior, if that fails. You will be whiped infrount of all the students to set an exmaple, and either kept in holding or sent to another camp."</p>

    <p>Some of the students turn a little pale from this, I imagine they have seen similar whipings used as punishemnt in their villages before. If they are from the cities I would be willing to bet on it.</p>

    <p>"Look, just don't do anything, and if you are told to stop doing something just appologise even if you don't think you where doing anything wrong. Better safe then sorry. Now let's get you training. You'll be doing one week in your roles, one week in your party, one week in your unit and then a week of assessments. Since it is week one we will be spliting up here I will stay with the support here and we will have all the Tanks over by that tree, all the DPS over by that hill."</p>
    <!-- End of Fredrich POV -->
    <h4>Effi POV</h4>
    <p>There was 20 others in the tank group, a mixture of boys and girls. Mother would often tell us tales of battles long past where the women of Alden would kill the men from their own country if he was caught fleeing from battle. I knew the stories where true but I was still expecting most of the camp to be boys, I am glad I was wrong.</p>

    <!-- maybe write this later -->
    <p>The lesson was simple, we started off comparing levels then it was about the role of tanks, what they should do during a fight. What weapons are useful and not for the role, quick pratices with all kinds of weapons and shields. After praticing with various partners and getting to know each other abit more Effi soon found out of all the tanks her level was very average if not on the low side, the instructor said they would have to work in their units to slay more monsters and level up to at least 10 by next month.</p>

    <p>Once lunch was over they went over holding the monsters attention, if the monster was to attack someone other then the tank, someone with less defence, less vitality they would die very quickly, thus the tanks job was to protect the rest of the group by holding the monsters attention and taking the damage for them. This is why the class suited Effi, she wanted to protect thoes share cared about. Protect the rest of her family from the fate her sister had met.</p>
    
    <p>With the aproval of her teacher Effi spent one of her skill points in learning the skill "Provoke" which forced a single targets focus on her for a short period of time and made her the targets first to attack in the unit. They praticed with the help of each other and the teacher until the afteroon. It was now time to go back get have a second lunch and study.</p>

    <p>Once she had made it back to her room Effi changed into her casual uniform and put her formal uniform though a quick handwash in the washing area downstairs next to the kitchen and left it out to dry. While washing her clothes she had a quick check up on her stats.</p>
<!-- Charge, Moves quickly in a straight line

    <p class="stats">
      <li>Name: Effi.</li>
      <li>Level: 6.</li>
      <li>Primary Class: Fighter.</li>
      <li>Skills: 6.</li>
      <li>Titles: 0.</li>

      <li>Dexterity: 0</li>
      <li>Sense: 1</li>
      <li>Charisma: 2</li>
    </p>

    <p>She put her stat points into vitality and defence evenly until now. Now she found out that as a tank she would also be needing strenght, and possibly magic defence if they faught magic monsters, it might be a common tatic to cover for this weakness by the 2nd tank in a unit having high magic defence and her high physical but Effi wanted to be able to protect them from ALL monsters.</p>

    <p>If this was her plan, she might become a very defensive tank, but not very quick, not able to sense traps or changes and not very persuasive and would have to rely on others anyway, "why can't I just be good at everything?"</p>

    <p>Inside the common room she noticed she was not the only one who decided to study with the others and noticed that Sophia, Emilia, Ehrhart & Charlotte had also come into the common room to study. Since Effi knew Sophia the most, both being tanks she decided to see if Sophia would study with her.</p>

    <p>"Hey so, do you mind if I join you?"</p>
    <p>"Sure! you don't have to be so formal you know? You did spend 30 minutes trying to slam a sword into me just now"</p>
    <p>"Aha, well trying is the keyword there.." Sitting down at the table with Sophia, Effi lays her three books and sits.</p>
    <p>"You brought the rules book with you?"</p>
    <p>"Oh I kinda just grabbed all of them."</p>
    <p>"Well I was reading though the historys if you want we could pick out paths that suit ourselves and maybe compliment each other since we will be fighting togeather"</p>
    <p>"oh that sounds like a good idea, I kinda know what I want, well the result anyway I am just not sure about how to get there. What skills to pick up, what balance my stats should be..."</p>
    <p>"I think we are all in that boat, well most of us anyway. Charlotte over there is unsure of even were to start" At the menction of her name Charlotte just smiles, reading the historys also.</p>
    <p>"Yeah, picking out what you want to do with the rest of you life right now is really stressful.."</p>
    <p>"Well I am thinking a large battle axe alot of strength and vitality, the power to shake the very ground with my blows, kind thing excites me. What did you have in mind?"</p>
    <p>"Oh wow that sounds badass! I was thinking a big shield with a longsword."</p>
    <p>"hmm, I mean would you take some advice from me? from what I saw today you are naturally quite strong but not very fast. That was why your strikes where very easy to avoid or push away maybe a sword isant your thing but something...heaveier? so you can put that strength to use."</p>
    <p>"Ah, yeah mother always said I was slow with a sword, but until now I never tried any of these weapons before.. I'll read the historys with you now and see what I should do at level 10 maybe it will help me make a choice"</p>
    <p>"Sounds like a good idea"</p>

    <h4>Dinner time</h4>
    <p>"I cannot decide"</p>
    <p>"On your sub-class?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah, Paladin or Knight, Paladins are greay they protect people and have great defencice and even some healing skills but are so inflexable where as kights have so much freedom."</p>
    <p>"Ah yes the knight is the most popular sub-class for fighters, the jack of all trades. I think all first years go though the same dialema"</p>
    <p>"What about you?"</p>
    <p>"Easy choice, Barbarian! After reading the stories of warrior women I decided to become as famous as Blenda! You do know her right?"</p>
    <p>The woman who lead and army of women against the Empire when they tried to attack us while we were defenceless and proved to all of Alden woman where better then men? ofcouse I have!</p>
    <p>Johannes - "We all have been reading the history last night, it says equal to men!"</p>
    <p>Sophia - "You wanna die?"</p>
    <p>Johannes - "S-sorry"</p>

    <p>"Where is Konrad? Is he not eating with us?"</p>
    <p>*cough* "Err he's..."</p>
    <p>"He's flirting with the girls from fourth company, I don't know why you are so shy to say so."</p>
    <p>"He's...Urgh, whatever."</p>

      <h3>Missions</h3>
    <!-- defeating monsters in the local area -->
    <h4>POV - </h4>
    <p>One week after the start of lessons they all students where moved from their classes in their roles into their parties of 5. They had four days to pratice and get their teamwork togeather because on the 5th day they would be fighting a real monster togeather. Company II had decided on teams of:</p>

    <p>Effi, Naoki, Alajos, Johannes & Konrad.</p>
    <p>Sophia, Emilia, Klara, Charlotte & Ehrhart.</p>

    <p>Fredrich - "So to repeat what you have to do in short, learn to work togeather as a functional team, there are various activies you will be assigned to each whole or half day depends on the activity. I will be around but unable to simpley stay with each party all the time that would be unfair on the others. Take the activities seriously even if they are fun, difficult or boring" as on the 5th day your life might depend on it. Dismissed."</p>

    <p>In turn the team captain from each team made their way to the front and picked up a wooden baton with an activity on the reverse side.</p>

    <p>"What did we get?"</p>
    <p>"Assualt course, half day. Swap with puzzles"</p>
    <p>"So we have to complete and assult course as a team?"</p>
    <p>"Well yeah I guess it so"</p>
    
    <p>After ariving at the assult couse it because very clear this was not something someone could do solo. Their first obstical alone was a giant wall higher then any two of them even stood atop each other.</p>
    <p>"So... Thoughts, ideas?"</p>
    <p>"Well if we can get one or two of us up there, even then if they hand there hands down unless any of you can jump twice your own height..."</p>
    <p>"Let's see if we can get someone on top maybe there is more to this."</p>
    <p>"Well Effi well have to hold whoever goes up, but we will need another ontop of her for them to be able to make it to the top."</p>
    <p>"Why am I on the bottom!?"</p>
    <p>"You're the studest... You are the Tank."</p>
    <p>"...stuiped logic"</p>
    <p>"I'll stand in the middle, to give 'support' to the one that goes up"</p>
    <p>"Was that a pun about your role?"</p>
    <p>"Just get on with it"</p>
    <p>Effi is stood with Konrad standing on her sholders with Naoki and Johannes holding them from either side. Alajos starts climbing up them thinking this would of been easier if he started on top, once he climbs ontop of Konrads sholders he grips onto the top of the wall and pulls himself up.</p>
    <p>"So, what can you see?"</p>
    <p>"Another wall"</p>
    <p>"Don't joke whats up there"</p>
    <p>"It was not a joke."</p>
    <p>The group fall silent. Suddenly the end of a rope falls down from over the wall. "One at a time, there is no where to tie the rope onto so its just me holding it."</p>

     <p>Once atop the wall they could see Alajos was not joking it was another wall, but thankfully this one had a door inside.</p>
     <p>"So what is it this time?"</p>
     <p>"well truth be told the only thing up here was that rope, so let's try the door."</p>
     <p>Opening the door the party made their way inside, inside was a pathway that they could see the end of, it led to a cave exiting out the otherside and the sunlight could be seen pouring inside. The only issue was that the pathway was not wide, infact it was as wide as a person foot was wide. and on one side was a sheer drop and the other a wall.</p>
     <p>"So, think the rope is long enough to reach the other end?"</p>
     <p>"Nope, not even half way."</p>
     <p>"Should we go one at a time?"</p>
     <p>"and if you should slip and fall we morn you one at a time?"</p>
     <p>"I was only asking.."</p>
     <p>"Sorry, it just kind of came out. We are meant to do this togeather, theres enough rope to wrap around each of us so we are tied togeather and walk across togeather. If one of us should slip the others could help them stay up"</p>
     <p>"And if two of us slip?"</p>
     <p>"mm just dont think like that"</p>
     <p>"So, since the officers made this, do you think the drop is really fatal, I mean how far down could it even be, we only climbed one wall."</p>
     <p>"I mean, only one way to find out. I can't see the bottom but once you are down there you could shout back up how far it is."</p>
     <p>"I get the point"</p>
     <!-- puzzles -->

     <!-- giant wall, river, skyscraper, lasers, trap areas,  -->

     <p>"What even this time?"</p>
     <p>"Make a camp, campfire, tents, food, water and sleep there for the night."</p>
     <p>"Sounds easy enough?"</p>
     <p>"Don't jinx it."</p>

     <p>Arriving at the campsite they could not help but question if it was the right place, just down from the river and next to the forest in the east side of the camp. There was no equipment, no food, no water nothing. </p>
    <!-- camping stay the night  -->
    <p>"Are we at the right place?"</p>
    <p>Konrad - "Yeah, I spoke to some of the girls from the other team, apperently you get nothing and can bring nothing to this activity. You just have to make what you can with your skills."</p>
    <p>"So thats what you were doing with thoes girls"</p>
    <p>"Mostly, but I don't kiss and tell."</p>
    <p>Effi starts fake vomiting</p>
    <p>Naoki - "Putting aside the fun, I don't want to sleep on the wet grass. So what skills do any of you have that could help us here?"</p>
    <p>Effi - "Well, I have heavy blow. It stikes a target for high damage, it never said I had to use a weapon or the target had to be living. Maybe I can cut us some wood?"</p>
    <p>Johannes - "I can sort of clean the river water by purifing it, but the mana cost is high. Just to be safe we should also boil it."</p>
    <p>Konrad - "Not really a skill, but I can track down food. My sense is quite high and I did pretty well back in my home town. I also learn the tracking skill, I just haven't made up my mind yet."</p>
    <p>Alajos - "While Konrad collects the vegtables and berries I can hunt. I have the spear throw skill and tracking skill, kind of must haves if you are going to live in Chinga...Northen Alden. Long live the GrandDuchy."</p>
    <p>The group fall into an awarkud silence at the reminder of how the people of the old state of Chingaling are treated.</p>   
    <p>Naoki - "Effi, wood for fire, Johannes water, Konrad food, Alajos hunt until midday then make your way back for lunch even if you catch nothing and we can decide on how far we have all made progress before splitting up again. I will work on our acamadations."</p>
    <p>Konrad - "sounds good"</p>
    <p>Effi - "I'll get chopping!"</p>
    <p>The group go their serpate ways.</p>
     <!-- follow pov char -->

     <!-- lunch time -->
     <p>At just past midday they make their way back to the meeting point, the place they agreed to make camp, Naoki had dug a small hole between two trees, and placed logs around the edges. On the bottom was layed sticks and leaves intertwined, the roof was partally built sloping off to one side made currently just out of sticks and a rope like plant.</p>

     <p>Alajos "Hey Naoki that's really impressive"</p>
     <p>"Thanks Alajos, you had luck hunting I see"</p>
     <p>Alajos - "No luck, all talent."</p>
     <p>Alajos - "Now help me skin these things we can eat the rabbit now, the birds tonight."</p>
     <p>Naoki - "Yeah alright"</p>
     <p>"The shelter will keep the rain of us, what should we do for warmth?"</p>
     <p>"Fire, body warmth and hopefully I can get some help making small blankets out of these plants."</p>
     <p>"I'll give you a hand after, not sure the Alden's have any pratice at making their own shelter."</p>
     <p>"Ha, that is true thanks man."</p>

     <p>Late that night the party are sitting around eating the berries, vegtables and birds by fireside. The sun had gone down and Fredrich had come to visit them.</p>
     <p>Fredrich - "Evening all."</p>
     <p>The party stand, salute and greet their commander. "Sir!"</p>
     <p>Fredrich - "Good, sit. Now the night will be cold, somewhere around 5 or 6 degrees. While your accomadations look promising I decided to bring you blankets. Tell no one." Fredrich dumps a package of blankets wraped with string into Naoki's lap, as soon as he does he turns and walks back to the camp.</p>
     <p>"Well that was unexected."</p>
     <p>"But very welcome, let's get to bed"</p>

     <!-- Monster fight -->

     <p>Effi picked up a baton from the table and took it back to the group. Turning it over infrount of all of them they could see what monster they would have to fight.On the back side was a picture of a of a wild dog-like animal with a tail longer then its body. One word below it Ahuizotl.</p>

     <p>"What is this?"</p>
     <p>Alajos - "Ahuizotl, It's a strong monster. From the jungles of Chaibia, thick fur that acts as its defence against mosst weapons, small ears and a long tail or in this case 2, at the end of which will either be a hand like paw or stinger. Both are dangerous, its element is water, usually they hide in the depths and drag men under with their hand like tail."</p>

     <p>"So what should we do to prepare?"</p>
     <p>Alajos- "Hmm if its the stinger we will need cures for poison, if its the hand, chances are its a water arena and we will need to prepare for that, hard to say."</p>
     <p>Naoki - "I think we should level up, getting some of us to level 10 will really help."</p>
     <p>"You are not wrong but how do we do that?"</p>
     <p>Naoki - "The orders where to prepare for the upcoming fight, it never spcifed how. Why don't we go and hunt monsters?"</p>
     <p>The group reflect on Naoki's suggestion, after agreeing to it they go to Fredrich and ask for passes to leave the camp.</p>

     <h4>POV </h4>
     <p>Fredrich - "Well, you are not wrong, or even the first to ask. It is unusual for first years to take up monster slaying missions so early on, but I won't stop you, just suggest that you stick to missions in the 0-10 range. Even if you are in a group, level 10 is such a large change that it might be too difficult."</p>
     <p>Taking the slips the party bow and thank their officer.</p>

     <p>"Which mission did you grab?"</p>
     <p>"Well the choice was slimes or living mushrooms, that was all that was in our rank range. So I picked the mushrooms, levels range from 0 to 5."</p>
     <p>"Let's get to it!"</p>

     <p>After searching though the woods in the area given to them on a map the party soon came across a group of living mushrooms, Effi quickly used charge and glided into the first living mushroom smashing into it with her shield grabbing the attention of the monsters.</p>

     <p>Naoki runs up behind Effi and strikes the first monster with his katana, Naoki soon pulled back when he realised he had done less then 3% damage to the monster.</p>

     <p>Konrad and Alajos both use charge at the same time to move into range of the mushroom and attack using "quick strike" cutting the hp of the mushroom down by 6% each.</p>

     <p>Johannes used "quick strike" with his bow and arrow stuck the monster for another 6%. "This is going to take awhile"</p>

     <p>Soon enough the mushrooms fight back sending spores into the air and the closets charges awkuardly head first at Effi. Who just allowed it to slam into the shield and hit down ontop of it with her sword using "heavy strike".</p>

     <p>"Did it hurt how much damage?"</p>
     <p>"1 hp. I think we can just slaughter them, Johannes you got our backs if we mess up?"</p>
     <p>Johannes - "I am sure I can out cure 1 hp dammage"</p>
     <p>The group fight their way though the mushrooms easily, after having completed the mission they make their way back and grab another. Over the course of the week the group managed to level a few times but did not once try to fight anything above level 9.</p>

      <p>Alajos - "Huszár ofcourse."</p>
      <p>Naoki - Waving his katana around "Samurai, like you even had to ask" he laughs.</p>

      <h4>POV</h4>
      <p>"How long until the fight?"</p>
      <p>"We are up next so as soon as the other party finish we go on after."</p>
      <p>"Ah I hate the waiting.."</p>

      <p>"Company II, Unit G, Part 1."</p>
      <p>"Well that's us, lets go."</p>
      <p>Making their way onto the arena, infrount of them was a cage holding a twin-tailed Ahuizotl. Its fur was a dark blue, eyes black, so black there where no other shades of color inside. The two tails circled around over its head poised to stike.</p>
      <p>Effi takes to the front while as praticed Naoki supports her from her right side, her weakest side. For this fight Effi swapped her sword for a large one handed mace, hoping this was the right call to make since the Ahuizotl's fur made using slashing weapons very hard.</p>

      <p>Once the fight started the Ahuizotl wasted no time in pouncing towards Naoki only to be "provoked" by Effi, The first attack came in the form of two claws which struck down on her shield. Naoki saw his oppertunity and unleased a a devistating "quick draw" into the monsters nose, the damage was done and first blood was drawn. With a quick whip of its tail two stigers where sent flying towards Effi and Naoki, the former who took the hit with her shield and the latter with his sholder.</p>

      <p>While Naoki fell down in pain Johannes shot loose an arrow of healing which stuke Naoki in the back causing the wound to heal slowly, the only problem was the poison was still taking his life.</p>

      <p>Alajos had not been idle using his new increased speed to sweep around and launch an attack from the monsters flank, stiking with his saber into the monsters rear leg. When the monster spun to attack him he made a hasty retreat back to Konrad, who had arrived with a light thin sword in one hand and a bag of powder in another. He quickly threw the powder into the monsters face after it had turned to help Alajos's escape.</p>

      <p>Effi who was angered by her partners injury and having lost the monsters attention used "Heavy blow" into the monster behind, the heavy mace was very effective the feeling of crushing bones and flesh came back as a responce, she followed this up with a "shield bash" into the monsters face as it tired to turn around. Now with its full attention Effi continues to attack with her heavy mace.</p>

      <p>Johannes moves to pull back Naoki, he insists he is okay the officers will pull him out if is hp drops below 20%, he moves back behind Effi and stikes to cover her weaknesses. Alajos moves in and out striking from the flank and sides of the monster. Konrad moves in to deploy spikes onto the ground, he is a little too agressive and the monster lands a strike with his tail onto konrad, Johannes keeps him from falling too low but the tacs are deployed poorly.</p>

      <p>The monster moves to jump and bite down on Effi's sword arm but it is quickly met by Naoki's sword and a cut is left across the monsters eye. Konrad who has been weakned moves back only for the monster to to retreat from Naoki's blow, with the tacs now layed between Effi and Konrad.</p>

      <p>The monster jumps to Konrad, unable to move in and grab the attention of the monster because they could not move easily though the tacs and chose to move around Konrad's scream rang out around the area has the bite had gone deep into his arm, his sharp sword in though the monsters thoat.</p>

      <p>Effi slams the mace into the side of the monsters face to get him to back up and release Konrad, amazingly it works. Johannes tries to heal Konrad has his hp hovers around 30%. Effi enraged gives chase and "charges" after the monster.</p>

      <p>The monster bleeding from the neck turns and charges into Effi, but it is of little use to fight with its claws or mouth against Effi's shield, but its tails can make it around the shield. Alajos moved in quickly to deal as much damage as he could to the monsters legs, they where cut and weak from Alajos's repeat attacks.</p>

      <p>Alajos shouts "Watch out! Breath attack!" The monsters jaw opend unrealistly wide, a blue watey mist came out of the monsters breath. Effi jumped back in supprise as Naoki moves in and lunges his sword into the monsters mouth before dispearing into the miss and a bright light.</p>

      <p>Effi shouted and ran in a charget towards the monster, though the breath she felt her movments become slower the moment she came into contact with the breath. Naoki was on the ground near by and the monster had now a slash across both its eyes. Faliling around attacking randomly at any and all noises Effi banged her mace against her shield to keep its attention. Johannes quickly fired shots into Naoki once the mist had cleared up, the monsters hp was getting low, blood pouring from its neck, both eyes injured and its back legs shreaded. Alajos and Konrad charged in landing heavy & quick blows onto the monster its hp soon wilted down to nothing.</p>

      <p>The party had, with the safty next of the staff and officers defeated a level 10 opponent for the first time, and realised how large the jump was between their abilities and monsters of the same level. It took 5 of them to take down just 1 monster of similar level.</p>

      <p>With the joy of victory came more fruit for Effi as she too had finally become level 10 and was able to pick her sub-class.</p>

<h3>Mock battles</h3>

<p>The week following the party trials each unit was put into compition against two of the other units from their company. With no idea who they are up against the group decide to make plans in the common room.</p>

<p>The group formation of 2 tanks, 4 dps, 2 support and 2 healers orginated from fighting monsters it would of been more ideal if they all used similar weapons when fighting other humans but they would just have to make it work.</p>

<p>Naoki - "Since we are all at such a low level this will just turn into a brawl anyway, it's not like we have even started training in formations or with disiplin."</p>

<p>Klara - "I think Naoki is right, it is unlikly we can do anything complicated as we will just lose our plan the moment it starts. Everyone knows we should take out the healers then the support & dps and finally the tanks."</p>

<h3>Compitition</h3>
<p>The day came sooner then it felt like it should. Standing on the grassy field opposite another group of 10. With mace in one hand and a shield in the other, I took to the front facing down our opponents IIC, a party from the same company who we had trained with in the past.</p>

<p>The day was warm the sun shone from out right giving no edge to either party. Soon time for my mind to wonder on such thoughts past and a loud ringing noise was given off by a metal drum. Time to move.</p>

<p>Pulsing my legs left and right I moved in a slight zig zag movement towards our opponents, the first to meet my mace was a large broad man with a long round shield in one hand and a axe in the other. My mace shook his shield and he replied in kind with his axe. Rarther then meet such a force, I ducked down and rolled right and charged into a blonde boy with twin sabers, slamming my shield into him stopping him from charging my team.</p>

<p>I turned to see that the man with the axe had chased me down, soon I felt the cold bite of his steel axe take a chunk of my flesh. I unleashed a growling scream from my depths as I swung my sheild to protect my side, peaddling my feet to move back to keep them both within my eyes.</p>

<p>Trying to keep the attention on me and give my team room to move I slammed my mace into the floor using the fighters skill high impact. This cause small dammage to thoes around me focusing their attention back onto me. As my opponents moved in I gave a great shout with the skill battle shout, firming up the stats of myself and allies near by. Hopefully there where allies near by. As my vision filled with the light from the edge of the axe I protected myself with my shield and pushed the head of my mace into his shield to keep it off me.</p>

<p>Soon I was hit in the side by one of the blonde boys sabers, pain shot down my right arm but I knew I could not let him move away from me. I activated my taunt skill to keep him focused on me by spitting directly into his face. Even if just for a few extra seconds keeping him away from the rest of my team would be worth it.</p>

<p>The battle between us three continued back and forth, I was left on the defensive as was my role, my health started to fall as I continued to take their attacks dispite my defensive style, I would not be able to hold out against them forever. Defeating them was beyond debate. </p>

<!--  -->

<p>A thud hit the back of my helm, weirdly it did not sting like an arrow should but instead Johannes had healed me in his own speical way.</p>

<p>They had tried to ignore Sophia thinking she was a heavy tank, while it us true she is a tank, with alot of points into strength ignoring her was their mistake.</p>

    <!-- tank challenges -->
    <h2>Tank trials!</h2>
    <!-- <p>Effi POV</p> -->
    <p>Excited and nervous, the big day for tank roles has arrived. The trials for the tank class are similar every year so although they are easy to predict and prepare for that does not make them easy to pass. The first trial is physical endurance, the tank will have to withstand physical attacks until they drop the longer you can stand the more points you aquire. This is repeated for magical and mixed magical & physical attacks. After the first 3 trials the tanks have to be tested on their ability to hold the agro of an opponent, the longer they can keep a great blood hound focused on them and not the large pile of meat the more points they get.</p>

    <p>I walked to arena with Sophia, the arena for these matches was the usual arena for the matches between students. </p>
    <!-- scouting challenges -->
    <h2>Scouting Sport</h2>
    <p>Scouting trails vary each year, but they are all a kind of hide and seek. This year the target to seek is a wolpertinger, you will recieve more points for the type and speed in which it is obtained and returned to the camp. However the hiding part of the challenge is to avoid the Bahkauv found thoughout the forest. They appear as a small calf with fangs claws and a long tail, they mostly appear in around sources of water, so the challenge level is not too high, but they do prey on the children of Alden who wonder too far alone.</p>

    <!-- dammage challenges -->
    <h2>Damage Dealing</h2>
    <p>This event sounded easy on paper, who ever inflicts more damage is the winner. The catch? Acctualy hitting the target. Elwetritsch, a chicken like creature with scales in placeo feathers, although it's wings are useless it sure can run, dodge and if cornered their scales will protect them long enough to land their beaks into you. Who ever kills their Elwetritsch first, wins. Simple.</p>

            <h2>Beke - Secound Year</h2>
          </header>
          <h3>One year since leaving the village.</h3>

          <p>Time sure flew by quick, I did not return home for the winter or the summer like the other students. Truth be told I was happy to be rid of the other village students, my family I would of liked to of seen but no doubt they still judge me for being a Rogue.</p>

          <p>To think I hate being a Rogue at first, it suits me. My first solo kill was a brown boar. Even with the Rogue skills I picked up on the way it was no easy fight, but compared to what came after.. I'd rarther not go though that experience again.</p>

          <p>After the boar had chocked out its last breath of life a small whispy light blue orb appeared above the boar. Something like it's spirit I guess, whatever it was I had to eat whole, then once it was inside me I had to circulate my mana and break down the orb into my mana and move the contence to my brain. For the next 6 hours I thought I was a boar, I moved like it did, I did the things it would of done before dieing. I lived as a boar for a few short hours and his memories became mine. It would be weird enough to share the memories of another human, but a boar, somethings you just want to unsee.</p>

          <p>I gained power though, put all my points into vitality and strength. The skills though, I ignored the human skills, I even ignored most Rogue skills, no what I picked where the skills of the Boar. Thick fat, Olfaction, Hoof Protrusion, etc. By just age 15 I had already reached level 17, I was aiming to reach level 20 before I turned 20. If I couldn't do that I was no combat class but a civilan. I once heared that the archduke's eldest son had reached level 30 betime he was 20, but with that much money I am sure even I could do that!</p>

          <!-- Thick fat - ignore damage less then a certen amount
          Olfaction - great smell 
          Hoof Protrusion - rough / flat terrain + // bad at swimming and snow+sand.
          boar rush - big charge attack
          Charge!
          Dermal Armor
          Enhanced Bite
          Enhanced Endurance
          Enhanced Hearing
          Enhanced Smell
          Enhanced Strength
          Enhanced Speed
          Expanded View
          Tusk Protrusion
          Wild boar Physiology: Enhanced Strength, Feral Mind, Environmental Adaptation
          Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): If the boar takes 7 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 Hit Points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.
                  -->

          <p>I came back from my morning traning to sit and each breakfast with the other students, all the secound year students had reached level 10 and absorbed a spirit already but some were clearly better then others and I would not assossiate with trash that took the spirit of a dog or a rat. My asssosiates, Kraft, Markolf, Anselm & Sieger. All from Alden non of them from Banderdam, no I might as well of absorbed the spirit of a mouse if I was to assossiate with their kind either. We beat them in the war, they should show us some respect.</p>

          <p>Making my way over to the the breakfast table and sqeesing in between Markolf & Anselm. "Todays the day." I gave Markolf a nudge with my arm. He knew what I meant. For the past month we had been researching and tracking a flower-horn. It get's its name from the flowers that bloom from it's many horns, depending on the color of flowers you can determin where it was born. It has four thick legs, the older ones often have mushrooms and other fugi growing up the side, a large mouth and a thin short tail. Most noticable however is the large mound on its back with a hole on top. Here rain water collects along with whatever else happens to drop inside prehaps thinking the collection of water and this slow wondering creature only eat plants. Nothing could be further from the truth, once inside what lays beneth the surface of the water is another smaller mouth, powerful enough to crush and pull you in for digestion.</p>

          <div class="pop">Banderdam<img class="popOut" height="400px" src="./images/forestthing.jpg" alt="Banderdam"></div>

          <p>Today was the day our little band was to attack it, today was the day that Chingaling Soós Krisztián would die. That short weasel faced scum was put into our group during the start of our time here. It's got to the point where I can't stand the smell of him anymore, the way he speaks, the way he acts even the way he eats disgusts me. We are told by the government that they are Alden's people, but we don't see it that way, and neither do they. Thinking about this made me too mad too eat. I left the breakfast hall and threw my bread at the back of the head of one of thoes savages.</p>

          <!-- forestthing.jpg/png -->

          <p>The grass outside was set wet, I made my way from the dinning tent back to my room. I changed from my training gear into our combat outfits, heading back out and to the gathering point just past the camp and on the edge of the forest.</p>

          <p>Shortly the others started dripping in until our team leader Norbert had shown up and we set off, I was upfront as always with my new outstanding sense of smell and thick hide I made a good vanguard all by myself. Kraft, Markolf, Anselm & Sieger where all dammage dealers behind me, Norbert was the second tank and stayed at the back while travling. Soós and his friend Yvonne where a healer and suport, both useless.</p>

          <p>We walked though the thick forest, the trees were spaced out near the camp, the floor lined with leaves, dirt and whatever else fell in a forest. This part of the forest was well travled by humans, and cultivated to be this way. Further in was our prize. Where the forest became thick, the ground less travled by humans. Some believed the inner forests to be unwalkable, the trees close togeather and the ground littered with forest debree, I believe they have never seen the size of the monsters lurking in the forest, they are more then large enough to move the trees appart and crush all below them into a fine flat paste.</p>

          <p>We walked for hours before finally that familia smell grew stronger, one I have been tracking the movements of for weeks. We moved to get closer and closer, there in a clearing eating it's way though a fawn was a flower-horn. They too where a type of Rogue able to absorb the spirits of its prey, this one was somewhere between level 25 and 29. It should in theory be a good target for us to hunt without any deaths, but just dangerous enough that a death would not be suspicious.</p>

          <!-- POV change to Norbert -->

          <h4>POV Norbert</h4>

          <p>The flower-horn looked like a cross between a fat bellied boar and a tree. The horns which grew from the top of its head instead of tusks bloomed a soft pink flower, this kind of color was quite common as it meant the creature was born near by in this forest.</p>

          <p>Time to take action before we are spotted, it's eye on our side was facing the floor, almost sad looking, i'm told they always look that way. I would send our damage dealers to the flanks, Beke would be sent to the right to guard them, he's proven time and again he will not protect Soós even though he is the healer. Yvonne would be sent to the left to help the faster ones dive in and out of the battle. I strode forward when I saw the team was in posistion and Beke had steped too far foward and alrerted the beats to our presence, slaming the flat side of my axe against my shield I provoked the beat to me, it quickly charged, I activated Badger Fur and tanked the dammage, 32% of my health. I struck back with my axe and activiated Beserk-Badger, my attack stat raised for a short time. Less then 1% of it's health dropped. I smiled to myself, this would be a long fight, the damage dealers where all spider/snake builds and one fire-salamander that dispite it's name also gave venomus skills. As you can imagine a forest creature like this had high resistances to venom.</p>

          <p>As the fight progressed the damage dealers on the left would sweep in quick strike and flee, Yvonne would kick up dirt, sticks and other degree to cover their retreat. Beke would provoke it and his team would take over while I recieved healing. Beke was a better build for a tank no doubt but he had no leadership qualities and was too unstable to be a main tank.</p>

          <p>It's health was dropping, it was becoming slow, its dark amber blood made the floor around it sticky. We were doing well dropping it's health about 6% ~ 10% per rotation, soon enough the creature became desprate and activated some kind of rage skill similar to my beserk. The left wing sweeped in and jumped away with just one attack each, now it was too dangerous to be caught trying to land more damage onto it. In came the right wing and back to me, I provoked the beast slamed my shield into it and sliced down into its head with my axe, it was coated in thick amber blood. Soon the beast turned from me without reason, it charged to Beke and Soós who was healing Beke before he would come back to me, all I could see was the cratures behind and hear Soós's scream as his leg was crushed under the beats hoof, the lower half of his face crushed by it's powerful jaw his eyes a mixture of blood and tears looking distraut in death. We had praticed for so long, we had studied it's movments, we had studied past battles and sort wisdom from our officers, even while beserk the beast should still of been provoked by me, and either tank strong enough to hold back the beast even if it charged.</p>

          <p>How? How? How? Soon I lost my calm mind and rushed in swinning my axe and screaming in a beserk rage. It was not long before the beast who was in the throws of death joined Soós.</p>

          <!-- Change to Kraft -->
          <h4>Pov Kraft</h4>
          <p>Soós lay dead, Beke was the most suspect not the flower-horn. He had never liked Soós and even spoke about him meeting and accident, usualy such talk was met by silence and his own laughter as if he did not feel the air in the room. Norbert who would be blamed for his parties failure was going beserk, red in the face screaming at Beke who just kept that ugly smile of his and played it off like he had no part in it. With Markolf & Anselm the only others on the right flank i'm sure the offical stories will be that no one saw anything, it's not that they like Beke, but the hassel would be less if Soós's death could be cleanly blamed on the monster and Norbert's failure.</p>

          <p>Yvonne was stood by my side, Sieger by hers. She wore a face of shock, horror and well, her friend just died she was distraught. With Norbert screaming at Beke and Bekes guilty smile she should know what went down. Sieger just looked to the sky, as if he was praying to take flight and leave this situation.</p>

          <p>Back at the camp the officers took us aside one by one, what good that would do since we had been togeather all day and asked us what happend. Naturally no one saw anything, Yvonne and Norbert blamed Beke with no evenidence. The officers removed Norbert of leadership and tried to give it to me. I refused. For that I was put into holding for 7 days. Sitting on the stone floor behind bars I would not find out what the outcome was until I was released, better they just disband this group but they won't. Who ever accepts the command of that group instead of declineing would be a fool.</p>

          <h2>POV Beke</h2>
          <p>I steped out from the holding cells a free man breathing the foul air deep into my lungs. Yeah they held me for a few days, asked some questions but I knew and they knew no one really cared what happend out there, just another dead savage from the wastes. Even their homeland seeks to push them away, wet, thick rainforests swaming with monsters. One even told me deep in the forests there are areas where the grass givesway under you and swallows you whole. The land itself must be desprate to get good blood back into it.</p>

          <p>A creased and crumpled paper was sitting in my pocket as I ran my finger over it, thinking back to what one of the investigators had said. He had given me this paper and said they where looking for men with the will power to do what needed to be done. Walked off right after. It was an address of one of the other groups in the camp. Secound years, rich kind it seemed.</p>

          <p>Although all students were given the same accomadations, on the outside. After a few weeks passed it became clear the rules where different depending on which family you came from. No servants where allowed in the camp, but that didn't stop some students using their wealth, power and influence to turn the other students into servents for them for 2 years. I don't care, a man gets what he takes, their farthers just took more then mine, but I will take more then them.</p>

          <p>After knocking on the door it quickly swung open to a pretty boys face. Blonde hair, blue eyes, tall and lean, the kind of Alden you think about when you talk about the nobility. He gave a sly half smile, the kind that made him look like he was up to no good. The kind that made you want to punch him square in the face.</p>

          <p>Noble - "You must be Beke, we had heared you have talent. Do come in, there is beer, masato & pálinka in the cabanit help youself."</p>

          -->

          <p>Beke - "I'll taken Alden beer, you can keep the the savages pisswater, or better yet throw it."</p>

          <p>noble - "Ahaha, I knew I would like you. The cabanit only has Alden beer and republic whisky inside. Had to test you, you understand right?"</p>

          <p>Beke - "Keeping out the savages of east? Yeah I get it."</p>

          <p>Soon enough the room was filled with fancy sorts. I couldn't deny it though, they where strong. The people of Alden had various hair colors, eye colors. Hell it even encompased the lands of lesser cultures who could not stand on their own. Brown hair, eyes, blue eyes, blonde hair but what stood out most was the girl was deep blue hair which becamer lighter towards the tips until it was as if invisable threads. Her eyes did not shine, but where a deep endless blue. They looked purer then water itself.</p>

          <p>Noble - "Now we are all gathered here. I would like to introduce the reason we are here, Beke." He pointed to me with his whole hand palm face up, and added. "And for Beke may I introduce our little group, The protective order of Alden." He gestered around to the people filling the room.</p>

          <p>Beke - "The protective order of Alden? Protected from what precisely?"</p>

          <p>Noble - "Ah that, yes we are the protective order of Alden, we protect Alden from ... the influences of the more savage aspects inside and outside of Alden." He smiled at me as if to try to push the rest of the message entirly though my mind.</p>

          <p>Beke - "That sounds like an idea I could get behind and support. So what is this? An initation? An offer?"</p>

          <p>Noble - "Ah, an offer to join ofcourse. We could always use more like minded people, with skills to match."</p>

          <p>Beke - "What is it I have to do?"</p>

          <p>Noble - "Ah, for now nothing, but in the future we put our own kind first and once you are in a good posistion you return the favour by helping more of our kind. You get me?"</p>

          <p>I nodded, a big grin overtook my face, seemed like luck had really taken a shine to me. From being accused of murder to friend of nobility all within a few hours. We had a small party after, drinks, food and got to know each other. The girl with the stunning blue eyes was the daughter of a duke from Basel close to the border regions, as for her eyes and hair, I did not ask. The other students where mostly minor nobility or the offspring of people in high posistions, as for the nobel who let me to start with, he was named Thomas von Absberg he was a noble with a high position from Grafen.</p>

          <p>The students of the village would all head off on the same day, they would travel to seprate destinations and along the way change the adults traveling with them, at first the instructors of the village hall travled with them until they reached the town of Todtenwei. From there they would change guardians every town/village or city until their destinations. Between Todtenwei and Shomberg was the 2nd Regiment of Aldens camp, there where many Fighters who would join the training camps near by and once the remaineder of the group joined the main road south they lost the majority of the other students are the large Grafen military training camp. The group would further split at the Lobach river where the 3rd regiment of Alden where based, thoes heading north from here went to the capital Alden or Banderdam near the Mages academy. South would be heading Haisengen and then into Huonhia. The group would continue to split and have new students join all the way until Argavereri. Although the jorney to this point had been as expected where small monsters where driven off by the numbers or guardians the road to Banderdam traveled close to Huonhia and near an area often overrun by monsters. It was a rainforest where a few major rivers became one and followed into the sea, if it where not for the abundance of monsters it is likely this would be the location of some major cities.</p>

          <p>Otto found himself walking next to a tall boy with short brown hair. He had the makings of a small mustashe on his upper lip, a refined pointed nose and a bit of achne around his cheeks.</p>
          <p>"Names Leon, if you care to ask"</p>
          <p>"Oh sorry, was I stareing?"</p>
          <p>"Maybe a little, and we have been walking next to each for for 2 days now."</p>
          <p>"Ah, I am sorry..."</p>
          <p>"It's fine, you from far? you look tired, like you have been walking for awhile."</p>
          <p>"Steinauhau"</p>
          <p>"...Dosen't get much further then that in Alden, you ever been to Chingaling land before?"</p>
          <p>"Chingaling? I am going to Tirnavalli Dukedom. Banderdam."</p>
          <p>"Ah, sorry forgot my place, thats correct, how silly of me."</p>
          <p>"What is Chingaling land?"</p>
          <p>Leon stared at Otto. "You really don't know?"</p>
          <p>"Woudln't of asked if I did."</p>
          <p>"Suppose so, thought you were just a die hard Alden, well Chingaling was a country before, made up of people from Hathapatson to Dodgud. Alden and Huonhia split the country in two and claimed it for their own. Although the offical story is the people of Banderdam where demon worshipers so Alden occupied that area and Huonhia occupied the rest to protect the people from Alden. I suppose the truth depends on who you ask."</p>
          <p>"So you must be local then?"</p>
          <p>"Aha, yeah, born in Banderdam. Still live there now with my little sister and little brother."</p>
          <p>"Erm your parents?"</p>
          <p>"Monsters, Ethautenheim to Banderdam passes though the province of Bilkotgopia. Risky trip but pays well, work at Banderdam depends on the ports and the academy. Both do poorly in the winter."</p>
          <p>"So you make this trip every year?"</p>
          <p>"First time. I didn't dare go outside of when the students travel, less guards. Less of the ones that will help you anyway."</p>
          <p>"Makes sense you can blend in easily becasue of your age, is it not a risk for you to tell me all this?"</p>
          <p>"No, not particularly. It is no crime to travel at the same time, and traveling in numbers offers its own kind of protection."</p>
          <p>"Well I am glad to have you with me, if we get lost you must know the area."</p>
          <p>"That is true, but I am no fighter, I am training as a shop keeper, an apprentise. You know, if I get back."</p>
          <p>"You'll make it back, I am sure. There are nobles kids in this group the guard's won't let the monsters near them."</p>
          <p>"Yes, near them. But we are not them."</p>
          <p>Otto pauses to think, he has a point but if we are just near by they will have to protect us even if they don't mean to.</p>

          <p>Leon - "you're a mage with no wand? I think that is fine I have seen loads of mages without wands. If you really have to have a wand you can pick one up in Banderdam, being so close to the Mages collage means they often stock thoes kind of things."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I still want to get one though"</p>
          <p> Leon - "Yeah, looking at Pal's shop it seems many students think the same way, maybe it's the books they make you all read brainwashing you into buying wands."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Aha, you might be right you know, we all have to read the same books to start with."</p>
          <p>Otto - "There is alot of noise coming from thoes nobels up ahead. Didn't think they could get any louder."</p>
          <p>Leon - "Drunk no doubt. Sounds like they are play fighting."</p>
          <p>Otto and Leon turn to look at each other realising there is no way they are play fighting like little kids at a time like this.</p>
          <p>Leon - "Into the northen tree's, if we are lucky we can go around."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Won't there just be more monsters in the trees?"</p>
          <p>Leon - "Chance of monsters is still lower then definatly monsters"</p>
          <p>Otto - "But the guards." Before Otto can finish his sentance he see's a nobels guard cut down a 14 year old girl from neck though the body and out though the opposite side just above the hip. To far to hear what the guard said it looked as if they had turned on the other students. Following Leon, Otto ran as fast as he could until they where just beoynd the sounds of metal, shouts and screams.</p>
          <p>Sitting inside of a ditch with hastily assembled twigs, leaves and dirt above their heads Otto was looking pale as Leon tried to slow his breathing.</p>
          <p>Leon - "Welcome to Bilkotgopia."</p>
          <p>Otto - "That some kind of joke?"</p>
          <p>Leon - "Yeah, sorry. A dark one, close to the truth. In Bilkotgopia people go missing, it's always blamed on the monsters but strong monsters rarely travel accross into Alden."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Truth and lies must be hard to tell appart here."</p>
          <p>Leon - "Yeah, at least im upfront about which side I am on, I won't be turning against you. I just want to go home."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Like you said you are not a fighter, but can you guide us to the river just past this... mess"</p>
          <p>Leon - "Polite way to put it, but yes I can. After that we follow the river takes us to Banderdam."</p>
          <p>Otto - "The river safe?"</p>
          <p>Leon - "Ahum.. once we get out of Bilkotgopia it is."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Let's move before we have time to take in what happend or worse it comes this way."</p>
          <p>Leon nods and they crawl out and make their way though the forest towards the river, any sound of battle had died out they where too far from the road now to hear anything anyway. After 90 minutes of walking they where getting to where they wanted to be, Leon had been following signs and markings left behind by his people, signs to help them avoid the guards but Otto did not need to know that.</p>
          <p>Leon - "Can you hear. Moaning?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Like an old man waking up."</p>
          <p>Pushing appart the brances Leon peered forward and infrount of him on the ground was a dead student & the upper half of a dead man. The dead student was a first year, 14 years old like all the others the same age as Otto and Leon. She had light brown hair, slim body and face, with a small pointed nose. The half of the man that was left had blood seeping out of the cracks between his burnt skin, there was no hair on his body and his lower lip was completly removed along with his ears. He was currently eating the girls insides though her belly tearing at the flesh with his hands of bone and burnt rotten flesh, shoveling the meat into his mouth where most of it ended up back inside the girl though the gaps in his teeth.</p>
          <p>Leon vomited, loudly. The monster screamed towards Leon and dragged it's self at supprsing speed towards him. Otto having seen Leon vomit had rushed over to help him, upon hearing the scream and seeing the moving cadaver chaseing them down he tried to push his mana though his body and out of his hand like he had with the Kappa. The rush felt easier this time with all the pratice he had had the ball of light shined, pale blue glow shone off the ground and trees before the ball spiraled forward blinding the monster for a moment giving Otto the chance to free Leon of his short sword, Otto ran towards the monster and kicked dirt up into its eyes and mouth, it flailed about and pushed the dirt from its eyes before showing his teeth in a growl. Using this time Otto ran in a circle to the side of the monster before turning on his heel, running stright for the monster holding the blade by his side and lunging it into the creatures head.</p>
          <p>Otto wondered if there would be another level up or notification, but nothing happend. Letting go of the blade and turning to help Leon back up Otto heared a low growl and turned to see the monster was not dead and moving about with a sword sticking out from its head. Otto jumped around as the monster made swings from the ground before grabbing hold of Leons sword again and swining it smashing the monsters head to pieces over and over.</p>

          <p>Leaving Leon against a tree to recover himself Otto starts to search the dead student, finding on her some coins, accessories and a few school supplies and food.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Guess she wasen't a rich girl." Grabbing the ID card 'Lea Müller'. "You know her?"</p>
          <p>Leon - "No, Alden name, not from here."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Makes sense, can't carry her so I will take the ID card to the town and report shes dead or something. Let's get out of here."</p>

          <p>Making their way back to the river Otto and Leon where on the otherside of the river to the main route. Since they had passed into Tirnavalli they could see a few boats moving down the river, and a few coming up. They manage to flag down some passing guards and explained their story to them, Otto gave over the students ID and told them where they could find the bodies. Otto and Leon then joined them in the boat on the way to Banderdam. </p>

          <h3>City of Banderdam</h3>
          <p>Arriving before the city of Banderdam where trails of students heading to the academy which lay near the city. The city itself was across a small stone bridge across the river Chitna which ended just short of the citys gate house where a wooden drawbridge made up for gap. There where square shaped towers all around the walls spaced appart, with a wooden building built atop. The gate house seem to of been rebuilt with diffrent color to it, the towers were circular with stone walls to the pointed rooves. There was a walled and rooved walkway between the two towers visable from the outside as it ran over the gate house giving the defenders room to drop things onto attacks. Even the older towers and walls had maticulations.</p>
          <div class="pop">Banderdam<img class="popOut" height="400px" src="./images/sergei-panin-04.jpg" alt="Banderdam"></div>

          <p>After getting out of the boat at the tempary station set up to deal with the large influx of people Leon and Otto made there way to the town by foot.</p>

          <p>Once at the gate, guards where outside checking people coming into the city. With his ID card, letters of introduction to the magic academy and his age it was easy for Otto to pass though the gate. Leon livied there so he was able to pass though the smaller gate for the locals. Meeting up again inside Leon took Otto to the shoping distrct so he could drop off his package and Otto could go shopping for a wand.</p>

          <p>The town inside was packed, the buildings clearly had been built with space between them to avoid fires but smaller tempary stuctures, carts and peaddlers had set up in thoes spaces selling and buying goods coming and going from the ports of Tirnadepal and Tirnavalli. There were ofcouse also goods being sold espcially this time of year for new and old students entering the academy.</p>

          <p>Leon had taken Otto to a wand shop that had been there since before Banderdam was appart of Alden. Inside was clean, really clean. Not a single spec of dust was anywhere to be found, the wands were displayed around the shop in glass cases and up on the walls in glass cases. Each wand had a card next to it with its discription and price.</p>

            -->

            <p>To put it bluntly, it was hard to miss. That wand stood out from the others, and not in a way that made him want to buy it. While thinking what kind of mad man would make such a thing let alone sell it his thoughts where intrupted.</p>
            <p>"First time? I wouldn't reccomend that particular one"</p>
            <p>"Uh yeah, it's my first time here. I won't be getting that one, what even is it?"</p>
            <p>"Ah, not all items are made, some are dropped by monsters so it's hard to say. Let me help you out, this is my shop I can do at least that much, names Pal" He said his hand streched out.</p>
            <!-- pall means Tiny, petite -->
            <p>True to his name he was a small man no more then 150cm, Otto reached out and shook his hand.</p>
            <p>"So first tell me, do you know what field you would like to go into?"</p>
            <p>"I am not too sure myself, I know I want to take the elements eletric & wind."</p>
            <p>"Ah, a battle mage then?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, sorry I should have specified."</p>
            <p>"A mage who appologises, rare."</p>
            <p>"Are other mages rude? Is it only thoes with bad parents who become mages?"</p>
            <p>"Ahaha, might be so, we just say it is because they think they are gifted more then others. Makes them arogent, if you keep away from being arogent and stick to what you want, you might jsut accieve it. But don't speak like that around other mages, you won't make friends that way ahaha."</p>
            <p>The shop keeper layed out 3 wands before Otto. "Nothing quite as fancy as some of the other wands, but at least useable by a beginer. Now I should explain the stats displayed are reflective of my measurements, thats to say how much it would increase by stats by just to give people a point of reference. The stats for when you hold it will be reflective of your own level."</p>
            <p>"Oh, I did not know that.. Can I ask, what level are you?"</p>
            <p>"33, I have spent more of my life as a shop keeper, item collector and appraiser. Combat magic is not my specality. I would of liked to of gotten a secound element but as you can see I did quite well enough without it." The old shop keeper smiled.</p>
            <p>"I cannot deny that." looking at the wands they had the cards displaying: {+3 Magic.}, {Once per day skill: Detect magic (1).}, {Once per day skill: Small gust (1).} Each had their own uses, the first wand would give Otto +0 magic until he reached level 10 however, but every 1 magic at any level is always a boon. Detect magic would be great if he ever got to go on a mission in helping find anything magical, and without having to spend a spell point to learn it. Small gust was a wind element skill, a support skill, all it did was as it was named, a small gust of wind would pass by, maybe to pick up sand or drit and throw it into the targets eyes, or dry clothes. Even so to find an elemental item a beginer can use was rare.</p>
            <p>"Ah you like that one? Hard to find an elemental wand that anyone can use, but since it is a first level spell it is something you can learn for free."</p>
            <p>"Not free, costs a point."</p>
            <p>"That, is true."</p>
            <p>"How much are they?"</p>
            <p>"Same price, ¤100,000"</p>
            <p>"Less then I thought, more then I have."</p>
            <p>"Only students from nobel houses pay with cash anyway, if you sign for something I can collect it later at the academy and they take it from your mission rewards, until they are paid back. Don't go crazy though they won't loan a first year more then ¤100,000."</p>
            <p>"Good thing the prices match then."</p>
            <p>"Don't look at me like that, I already discounted them so you could afford it if you like them, I won't force you, no doubt you will be coming back for many years."</p>
            <p>"Ah, thank you" Otto bows deeply. "Could I buy the detect magic wand?"</p>
            <p>"Feeling you might get lucky on a mission?"</p>
            <p>"The opposite, feel like I will be unlucky and not spot something."</p>
            <p>"It's yours, if I where you I'd keep it to yourself. Although it gives you access to the skill, still costs mana, you have to push your mana into the wand, though it and out the otherside. Normally I ask people not to test wands in here but in this case it won't do any harm so give it ago."</p>
            <p>"If you are sure." Otto pushes his mana into the wand, it flows though like his arm is longer then normal feeling appart of him as far as the mana is conserned and out the otherside where upon Otto's eye sight is filled in color. Almost all objects in the shop glow different strange colors.</p>
            <p>"Quite the show isan't it? Almost every item in here contains magic so, thats why."</p>
            <p>"Why are there so many colors?"</p>
            <p>"Different types of magic, like the manastone when you touch it turns purple-ish right?"</p>
            <p>"Yeah"</p>
            <p>"Well" taking a mana stone out from his desk and leaving it in the palm of his hand, the stone turns from its usual sea blue to dark forest green."Wood is my element."</p>
            <p>Otto nods in understanding. After thanking the shop keeper again and leaving the shop with his new wand hidden away, heading to meet Leon at 'Főzelékfaló' a small cafe in the castle area, he ordered Főzelék as Leon had reccomended it. An intresting experience, tasted like thick vegtable stew although that discription does it little justice, so Otto became desprate to learn how to make it.</p>

            <div class="pop">Főzelék<img class="popOut" height="400px" src="./images/Főzelék.jpg" alt="Főzelék"></div>

            <p>"Good isan't it?"</p>
            <p>"Yeah, I don't really know how to describe it, can you make it?"</p>
            <p>"Yeah I can, but not as well. If you want to learn my sister will be able to show you, I am sure you will get time to come visit us the minimum stay in the acadey is 2 years after all."</p>
            <p>"I will, it's not like there are other towns near the academy, so I guess I will be coming often."</p>
            <p>"Aha you're welcome to, but you studies might be a little more intense then you think."</p>

            <p>After thanking Leon showing him where to get a good meal, and introducing him to a realiable shop keeper. Otto's jorney to the Academy was only a few short hours walk from Banderdam, although the other students often chose to spen their money on rented mounts, Otto could not ride, and was bankrupt.</p>

          <h3>Acadamey</h3>
          <p>The acadamey at first appeared to be a large and quite impressive but much smaller building than expected, situatied inside the rainforest Banderdam was famous for. With tall tress hiding the building from a clear view, as you got closer to the building you could see vines growuping up the side of the stone work, towers with no tops poked out from behind here and there, the place appeared to be in ruin in areas. Students could be seen on mounts, in carriages or on foot, unloading near the entrance. There where two large doors left wide open, standing near by where men dressed in an assortment of all different colors most in robes but a few in metal armor. Inside of the two doors where you would expect there to be stairs or a great hall was two giant stone spikes, they resembled claws and reached 30m from the ground to their top where they stopped just shy of the roof. Between these pillars was a mass of dizzing, swerlleling purple liquid, a purple Otto knew well, it was the same purple he saw the manastone turn back in the village hall.</p>

          <h3>Inside</h3>
          <p>Once Otto steped though the portal he could see streched out before him a long white bridge winged with more trees leading to a large palace, the door 30m tall appeared to be made of gold, with towers pointing up around the structure and beyond whos rooves where lined and eched in gold. Even the dome which sat above the maingate house appeared to be made of gold, the rooves a light blue pointed like castle from fairy tales, the walls pure white like marbel. The biggest change of all was that the rainforest was gone and replaced by towering mountins where the palace sat in the valley between.</p>
          <div class="pop">Acadamey<img class="popOut" height="400px" src="./images/academy7.jpg" alt="Acadamey"></div>

          <!-- stuff happens / sign up etc -->

          <p>Upon signing the scroll Otto felt warm and golden light bathed him. Then suddenly a message appeared infrount of his eyes. "Title: Back to School - Enter the academy, +1 Magic". Otto was elated, he had only just joined and already his magic was increaseing! Why was it called "Back to School?" if it is unlocked the first time you come? nevermind. He quickly loaded his stats.</p>

          <p class="stats">

          <p>"Room ****" A key is place in his hand as he is pulled back to reality. Slightly embrassed by his outbursts he quickly applogises</p>
          <p>"I am use to it, all commoners are the same when they first arrive."</p>
          <p>"Oh, I, sorry."</p>
          <p>"It's fine go find your room, there should be books and uniforms inside best to learn the rules before you break them."</p>
          <p>"Yes sir, thank you" Otto bows deeply before leaving to find his room.</p>

          <!-- Arrival at the room -->

          <p>Walking away from the main hall of the academy across other bridges and though streets, markets made of students and premitted merchants. They came with wagons, small shops in the bottom floor of housing the floor was layed in marble or stone. People wore either robes, with uniform markings but of differnt colors or bright colorful casual clothing. Otto was walking for while before realising he had surely come to the end of the large academy in this direction. The stone floor had turned to a dirt track, checking a nearby stone building for its housing number and checking it to his own he walked just a little further and saw the houses of stone had become wooden, although still nice. The rooves where pointed and curved at the end and looked like how he would imagine a house from Leika would be, trees stood around and he could hear birds singing. The houses in this area where built within or near trees and nature all around, the paths where grass which had been walked more often then the other areas. Wanting to look around some more Otto climbed one of the trees and looked into the distance, the forest was large, and in the distance he could see a very large structure where there was less trees, a huge wooden palace. There where sevral buildings inside and a small wall around the outside, unable to really be able to see any details from this distance he decided to drop down and keep on looking for his assigned room.</p>

          <p>After awhile he soon found a pathed road again, but rarther then the neatly placed stones in a stright line he found randomly placed rocks between mud leading up the side of a cliff. The cliff had dewllings carved out of the rock, it was about 5 floors high. Looking back he could see ciffs on the opposing side, they had red painted pillars and a water fall falling between and atop them elven dewellings with forests around, looking between the two cliffs the opposing cliff was much more welcoming.</p>

          <p>Walking to the door carved into the cliff Otto checked the sign carved into the rock beside the door. Yup, this was the building that matched his. There where a small set of stairs leading up to a large metal door placed inside of a natural looking cave entrance. The door was so large and heavy Otto doubted he could even open, that any man could open it. So he knocked and waited.</p>

          <p>A head poped out from a floor level window. "Who is it?" a girls voice came from inside and the head looking out responded "Another of the dammed, one of us." with a big smile and the door creeked and a portion of it opned only large enough for a single body to pass though. "Welcome home brother."</p>

          <p>Walking inside the main hall was much longer ande deeper then he thought back into the cliff, a good 1km or so. Not wanting to explore around this place too much he noted that there where large stone pillers with rounded hat-like tops. Below the 'hats' where holes and inside was a glowing ball, these pillars where lining the hall all the way down lighting it. </p>

          <p>Pushing the door to his right, and looking inside was the boy from the window, two girls and another boy. Looking between them Otto decided he should introduce himself.</p>

          <p>"I am Otto I am looking for my assigned room, the start matches this buildings so I thought it was in here."</p>

          <p>Ralsan - "That'll be the case, 51? 5th floor, room 1. Ralsan is my name, this is Tisiel" A girl waved her hand, "Shrorlei Crerlass" the other girl waved quickly once with her hand, "finally we have Reingard". The final boy waved. "We are the next first years staying in this building also."</p>

          <p>Otto - "I see, why are we the 'dammed'?"</p>

          <p>Ralsan - "Ah that, to be placed all the way out here in this erm abode is because you must be poor, have no connections to anyone important and no outstanding tallent. Nothing personal just how thigh higher up's view us, not to say all the poor reside here just thoes with no history, backing, connections, long distance cousins in high places. Bascily people who cannot complain."</p>

          <p>Otto - "When passing though the military camps I had thought they placed all children of any standing in the same accomadations."</p>

          <p>Ralsan - "Well yes, but this is not a military camp, and if you take a closer look you will find they are not put into the same groups at least."</p>

          <p>Otto - "Another might be disapointed, but I look forward to being away from the noise of the town during the night at least."</p>

          <p>Ralsan - "Aha, honestly the rooms are not too bad go up and take a look, we will be here."</p>

          <p>Otto - "Ah thank you, it has been a long way."</p>

          <p>Otto headed up the stairs to the 5th floor, 1st room.</p>

          <!-- room inside -->

          <p>Inside there was a window, a desk & chair, a bed that would fit a man twice his size and a bin. Next to his feet this area was slightly lower down then the rest of the room, for about half a meter in in diamater, here was a small rack for his shoes and an old plant pot with an old umbrella inside.</p>

          <p>After removing his shoes Otto walks over to the bed where 3 uniforms are layed out on the bed, a black robe, with a smart looking pair of black trousers and t-shirt (school and class emblems etc). The next uniform was just a 2nd pair of trouers and t-shirt without any markings on. The final uniform was much softer and thinner, with a note that read "SLEEP WEAR" ontop, maybe to save a first year of the embrassment of turning up to class in pajamas.</p>

          <p>On the desk where some books, with a note that said "Read Chapter 1 of MM&M before first class." "Academy rules, regulations and assesment criteria", "Mages, Magic & Mana The basics" & "Exemplary mages: a history".</p>

          <p>Leaving his belongings and deciding not to change into his new clothes yet Otto headed back downstairs to see if he could learn more about the housing.</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "I'll show you about if you like, won't take too long not much out this way, then after why don't you go into town with me and buy me dinner as tanks" she teased with a sligh smile</p>

          <p>Otto - "Be careful what you say, I might just take you up on that."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Let's start with the tour, some of the halls are dark, but I don't bite hard."</p>

          <p>Otto - "Pfft I'll keep you at a distance then."</p>

          <p>Tisiel took him around, there were shared bath's on each floor. Students slept and cooked on floors 2 - 4. On the first floor was a libuary, it was mostly unused and dusty, the only books to be found here where either centries old or older students books left behind. Walking further down the main hall on the first floor they came to a large circular door. There where markings all around. There where 4 circles, 3 outter circles had these weird markings around them and the middle circle just had one syombol also nothing that Otto had seen before.</p>

          <p>Otto - "And this is?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Sex dungon."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Aha, you have a strange sense of humor."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Fine you got me I have no idea what this is either, truth be told not sure anyone does. No one we asked know what it is."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Bad decore"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Aha, so how about that dinner?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Sounds good to me, I have no plans to cook tonight. Know any places?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Nowhere special but just past the Leika's area is the resturants that are cloest to here, they all seem fine to me."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Lead the way, I'll pay."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ohhh have you not spent the loan yet?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Ah, I mean. It's not really my money. We were attacked on the way here."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Do Alden gods not curse thoes who take from the dead?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Can't say I know of any curses but it is not like she will need it now."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "You are going to fit in here. Ahaha."</p>

          <p>Otto and Tisiel went out for dinner in the main town, she showed him around, there was more to do closer to the academy, from pubs, sports, gambling, dueling, and many other entertainments. The noteable places around the main academy where the market areas, the main of which had a large church near by, the large arena, the academys main libuary and mission office.</p>

          <p>After dinner they made their way back to the cliffside dorm. At the entrance to the door Tisiel spoke "I am home brother."</p>
          <p>To Otto's supprise the door spoke back. "Welcome home sister."</p>
          <p>Otto - "What was that?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ah, the password. The ciffside dorm is old, no one has explained how it works only that it does."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Well it is good to know how to get in, I was worried someone would always have to be inside."</p>

          <!-- sleep -->

          <h3>Lessons</h3>
          <h4>POV Otto Lesson on mages</h4>
          <p>"Now who can tell me what seperates a Mage does with their mana which seprates them from the Fighters?"</p>
          <p>"They project their mana into the world around them to cause change"</p>
          <p>"Good, you should all already know that having read chapter 1 of MM&M."</p>
          <p>"Todays lesson is about getting you all understanding the directions you can take as a Mage, the roles can fill in Alden and beoynd and ofcourse where to put your points."</p>

          <!-- Elements - different types of mages -->
          <!-- Jobs mages do outside of combat -->
          <!-- Combat mages, how to spend your points -->
          <p>So since we are at that time combat mages, how to spend your points. Firstly Magic also affects the total amount of MP you have, so that is usually the main stat for Mages even if you plan to be a front line fighter, healer or non-combatant.</p>

          <p>Now the other stat points there is no forumula for, so we have provided you a book containing what past mages have done and how it worked out for them you can either copy one of them or just learn from what they did and make your own path.</p>

          <p>Finally your spell points. These can be tricky you don't want to be investing all your points into an explosion style magic and then find yourself fighting with a sword, or worse, trying to farm.</p>

          <p>If there are any questions you will be seeing me once a day 4 days a week so please wait until you have read though  "Exemplary mages: a history" before asking questions as you might find your answers in there.</p>

          <p>The class shorly dismissed after, Otto went to the libuary along with many of the other students from his class and other first year classes. The main libuary was split into sections and first years who where not nobles of any kind could only access the first floor which soon became packed. Deciding he had the book he needed to read he would just go back to the cliffside.</p>

          <p>In the libuary on the cliffside Otto got to reading the historys by the light given off by the large stone pillers. After reading though so many of the Mages from the past he soon found himself bored and looking for anything else to distract him. He started looking along the spines of the old books around the libuary; 'Fire Magic', 'Faming with mana - Pocotcotcan magic', 'Lusty Ma...', 'The Summoner: Morian Zenas'. "Oh he's in the historys book, wonder if it's different".</p>
          
          <p>"I guess the people that wrote the historys just copied directly from these older books."</p>
          <p>Looking though the books again Otto finds a book half on its side, 'Otto Magnus Of Might' curious, Otto opened the book to find the pages had been cut clearnly and inside the book was a black key, and the number 34, and below it some strange makings, markings similar to the door shown to him by Tisiel. The key looked to be similar to the one to his room.</p>
          <p>This took no expert to figure out, no one had been into this libuary for a long time, the person who made that door must of lived in room 34 at sometime. If someone lives there now I will just have to be quick and use my wand of magic detection to see if there is anything there. Making his way to the room on the 3rd floor he pressed his ear up against it, no sound. Taking a deep breath Otto put the key into the door and turned it, click. He pushed the door open and sitting there looking back at him was Tisiel.</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Breaking into a ladies room without even knocking what kind of man are you?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Wait I can explain!"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "What you gonna tell me you found a book in the old libuary with strange syombols similar to the door?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yes?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ahahaha, it is my book, can't believe how quickly that worked you picked up the book with your own name on... Otto the mighty mage? really?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Hey it's not like the other mages had normal names and how did you know I would go to the old libuary and look though the books anyway?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Truthfully I didn't just took a chance to see if you where intrested in the door or knew anything about it, thats why I showed you around, no one else has taken any real intrest in it. So do you want to know whats behind the door?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Well, yeah"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Well come in, and give me my key back. There was a book in that old libuary with strange signs on like the door that I found weeks before you arrival, I managed to descifer some of it and it took me to one of the ruins just north of here, looked like an old part of the academy that had fell into disuse or something happend to it. Anyway hidden inside was this ring."</p>
          <p>Tisiel places a small dark grey ring down on the table, with the strange signs all over it glowly dimly red.</p>
          <p>Otto - "You did all that already? What does the ring do?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yes well, my specality is disyphering old texts and charms"</p>
          <p>Otto - "How do you already have a specality..."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "My parents do this sort of thing, they desypher old langauges, magic texts, relics and items. Also.. I am level 12 so I already picked my element."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Don't remeber reading about the desypher element but I am not going to lie that sounds cool"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "My element isan't called desypher, whatever I will just wait till you unlock your elements. The ring it's self though. Does nothing that I can figure out."</p>
          <p>Otto - "So when you say help, do you want me to try to and find what the ring does? help you read the text?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ah the help I need is well, do you have the skill Teather? It's just I can't learn it.."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Used all your points?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel nods in response. "But I also will need help going here" She holds out a baddly drawn map and points to a grave yard. "There is a chance we might be attacked so if I have you there... As long as I can outrun you they will be busy eating you while I get away. Deal?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "I'll learn teather, and maybe some other spells to help us KILL our opponents not run away."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I mean, as long as I get to live."</p>
          <p>Otto - "When are we going?"</p>
          <p>Titles - "I'll meet you out front in 5."</p>
          <p>Otto - "... Yeah alright."</p>

          <p>Later out infront of the cliffside.</p>
          <p class="stats">

            <li>Sense: 1</li>
            <li>Charisma: 2</li>
          </p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Whats that face?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Can't put any more points into magic. Why?</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "You can't put more points in then the level you are, points for items and your titles go ontop of that."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I see, then, I am not sure what other stats to get."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah, fighters have it easier, strength and either vitality or dexterity. For me I picked Magic and Sense, since I want to be an explorer."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Makes sense, I should pick vitality, defence, magic defence, dexterity maybe charisma...."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "You are just naming all of them."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Urgh I can't decide!"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Lets just go, you can pick on the way."</p>
          <p>Walking up north of the cliffs away from the academy the path soon becomes more dirt then stone, unused in so long. About 40 minutes later they arrive at the ruins of what could of been a small campus, it was hard to tell what it was with only the foundations of the buildings surviving.</p>
          <p>Otto - "This where you found the ring?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah, the grave yard was built outside of town though, I would of gone alone but, well you will see."</p>

          <p>Ariving before the grave yard the pair stare blankly forward. 10 meter black metal spikes raised from the ground placed close to each other too small for a person to pass though, with an eareie ghost like gas passing between the spikes.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Take it there is no gate?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Nope. This erm, wall is the problem I have."</p>
          <p>Otto - "And how will teather solve your problems?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Well, according to this book the ring has to be placed on that erm alter? inside the grave yard to prove you belong to the socity."</p>
          <p>Otto - "The alter is half a meter behind the bars, surely you can just place it on with your hand"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I mean, if you want to put your hand into and though that gas, I won't stop you."</p>
          <p>Otto - "... It's corrosive isan't it?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Very." Tisiel kicks a rock into the gas and it disappears before it can reach the otherside.</p>
          <p>Otto - "Amazing, and the ring won't disolve?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "If it does, it is the end of this mystory, but it shouldn't".</p>

          <p>With a shake of his head Otto picks up the ring from Tisiel's hand and places it on his own. He then pushed his mana though the tip of his finger and it came out like a rope. He attached the ring to the end of the rope like teather, it stuck when he willed it to grab the ring. Pushing the teathed ring into the gas he was supprised when nothing happend, pushing it past the bars and out and placeing it on the alter.</p>

          <p>Looking at each other, the bars shoot into the ground in an instant and the gas disapates. Behind is left grave stones, grass and a small stone mausoleum in the middle.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Ladies first."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Get moving you coward."</p>

          <p>Otto - "No zombies, supprising."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Don't jinx it."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Grab the ring?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "On the way out, same method or we die."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Glad I asked..."</p>

          <p>Opening the door and looking around inside, the pair see nothing, it's dark so they case mage light, mana gathers in the palm of their hands and gives off a small blue glow.</p>

          <p>Otto - "This is the light from the cliffside."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah I mean, it's a common and useful spell."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Ah"</p>
          <p>Inside was three stone boxes, the length and width of a man. On top of each of the boxes carved from stone was the sculpture of two woman and a man.</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Sarcophagus, Alden nobels are burried like this even today."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I did not know that. Our dead are burried in the village."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "We burn ours. Since you took money from a dead girl before, guess you won't mind breaking open some ones resting place?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "I don't mind, but you make me sound like a bad guy..."</p>
          <p>Tisiel just smiled as she crouched down opened the book and started reading and marking her fingers along the signs on the stone.</p>
          <p>Pushing the stone lids to one side in the first Otto found a skeleton of a woman, proberly the woman who was carved ontop. Prying the rings from her fingers and the necklase from her finally he took the tiara from her head. Tisiel looked up at him as he removed items from a grave with a strange look.</p>
          <p>Otto - "I remember this being your idea, you might need them"</p>
          <p>Tisiel just rolled her eyes and went back to studying the signs around the sarcophaguses. In the second was the skeleton of a man, a wand, crown and one ring. The third contained another woman, jewlery and one coin. Making small pile of loot on the ground Otto turned to Tisiel.</p>
          <p>Otto - "Learn anything?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I will have to keep coming here to read these, but the words I think I understand, he is a king, she was a queen and the secound woman was his daughter."</p>
          <p>Otto - "They died at the same time?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "No real evenidence of that. Let's see what you found."</p>
          <p>Tisiel looked though the items before deciding she had no idea which where important and which where not.</p>
          <p>Otto - "Look away for a moment."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Why?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Secret."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Fine, but no funny stuff."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Like I would..."</p>
          <p>Otto took out his wand and passed mana though it before placeing it back, he then moved the crown, wand and the kings ring to one side. The Queens tiara & ring. The daughters coin. "You can look again"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I had to wait for you to make two piles?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "The ones in this pile contain magic, these don't"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I won't ask how but it would be amazing if they still cotain magic, It must of been centries since anyone came here. Let's get them all back I can use my skills to desypher these items and tell you what they all do."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Sure, let's put them in your bag, keep them safe."</p>

          <p>When the pair step outside the mausoleum some of the stone stachues carved on the graves or around the mausoleum fell appart. One manages to maintain some of its form and runs towards Otto and Tisiel who split and run, seeing the stone figure of a warrior from an age Otto did not know was running after Tisiel.</p>

          <p>Running up to the golem Otto cast 'Strike' and the weak statue became enraged but the mana that stuck down from above him had almost tore his arm off. "Tisiel, Stike it." Tisiel turned and thew a ball of mana into it. One arm breaks off and Otto seeing manaball can be used as a weapon joins in and creates a ball of mana in the palm of his hand and slams it into the statue. Under the bombardment soon the statue fell appart with a creepy cry of anguish. </p>

          <p>Otto - "They must of all been guardians, for them to be so weak. Some of them even broke appart when activated."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "More impressive that they even activated, but that could help us determin the age of this place."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Been meaning to ask, if it has been here so long, don't you think someone else would of opened the door by now, or know what it was or what this graveyard is?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "It's possible, but the fun is in the discovery. Now get the ring with theather and let's leave before something else comes to life."</p>

          <p>Tisiel praticly locked herself in her room for a few days, only coming out to go to lessons and eat. Otto went to check on here everyday, it was amazing at the speed she desyphered at considering she had to make time for her normal studies.</p>

          <p>Teacher - "Todays lesson will be on comabt between mages, and a little on combat between mages and other classes. The upcoming duels have some of you excited, and this lesson is to help you prepare for the battle ahead. Now in real duels you will be premitted to use your own equipment but for this session you can only use the weapons provided to you, and the uniform you are wearing now. You may not enchant or enhance any of the equipment."</p>

          <p>"Now the most obvious thing when thinking about duels between mages is that they use magical attacks. Convention gives that should you be up against a mage Magic Defence is the best option to counter that as it reduces the damage by more vitality increases your health. However you must consider the bigger picture, once you leave the academy not all of your oppoents will be mages and some will use physical attacks and the points you put into Magic Defence will do nothing to protect from that.</p>

          <p>"The secound thing to think about during a duel although not as relivent during your lower levels is the amount of mana you and your oppoent have. If you run out of mana it is likely you will passout early on and be unable to fight."</p>

          <p>"Finally is the element type. You might be an amazing fire-mage but if your opponet is using water, you are at a huge disadvantage so keep that in mind. If there are no further questions about the duels we will move onto charms and how to counter them."</p>

          <p>The lesson continued as normal, reading though past mages, their feats and discoveries.</p>

          <p>Looking though the list of skills a lighting mage could learn Otto could not really decide which he wanted and which he should avoid. He narrowed it down to just a few he felt like he could use:</p>

          <p> 
            Chain Lightning,
            Dazing Bolt,
            Thunderstorm,
            Shocking Touch,
            Sparks,
            Lightning Bolt,
            Lightning Rune,
            Lightning Cloak,
            Thunderbolt,
            Static Field,
            Wall of lightning,
            Lightning Storm,
            Discharge,
            Charged Charge.
         </p>

         <p>He decided to pick up, lightning cloak, shocking touch, chain lighting, charged charge and wall of lightning.</p>

         <p>Thinking on what the teacher had said, mages in the duels would be using magic attacks so it is potent to put points into magic defence. But Otto wanted to think about the future also, no not putting points into defence but strength. There was nothing in the rules to say he had to use magic, and his element lightning would travel easier though a metal blade then a wooden wand.</p>

         <p>His hp at the moment was 210. The largest attack a level 10 student using a non elemental attack would be stike with no element would be about 100. Hoping even with the element added maybe he could take two hits. His plan would fall appart if the hit was a critical however.</p>

         <!-- level *5 magic * 8 = mp // level * 10 vit * 14.5 +100 = hp -->
         <p>Otto had made his preperations and headed to the arena where the duels would be held this week. Thoes not dueling would have to take notes and give feedback to thoes who where dueling.</p>

         <p>Otto would be dueling on days 3 and 5. He spent the first day watching his class mates duel, most of the matches ended quite quickly with the students hp being reduced in 1 to 5 hits. There was ofcouse the odd duel where two defensive type mages met and each would exchange blows of around 5% of their total hp and mana comsumption became important.</p>

         <p>Knowing his duels would not become a slogging match between two defensive mages Otto tried to concentrate on the matches between two offensive mages, or how to break though the defence of a defensive mage. What became very clear was that mages at this level where slow, not very powerful and had defences like paper.</p>

         <p>On the secound day he managed to catch that some of his house mates where signed up also and went to see their matches. Tisiel's match ended in her loss, she only signed up for the expereince and would never be a dedicated combat mage. Shrorlei's match was a weird one, with some of her spells not activating and her oppoents sometimes fizziling out, the teachers reacted with no shock at all like it was expected but some of the students, like Otto could not understand. Reingard overwheled his oppoennt with a constant stream of manaballs but soon ran out of mana and passed out, he had won the match however. Ralsan did not fight today and Otto had missed his first match yestoday.</p>

         <p>On the third day Otto equiped his formal outfit, mages robe and headed down to the area again. This time however instead of watching the matches he made his way into the armory beneath the area. Inside where many students picking out weapons and signing in that they where present. Otto signed next to his name picked up a completly metal spear and sat down to wait. He got a few weird looks, some of the students even pittied him thinking he must of thought the metal spear was some kind of magic staff, but non of them thought to correct him.</p>

         <p>Soon enough Otto's name was called, along with another boys Daniel. He was tall, a little chubby, with hair so short you could see his scalp like it had recently been shaved off and grown back. He had a friendly face however, squinting eyes that looked like they where smileing. He had a 20cm wand in his hand made of wood, the wood was much darker then the wand Otto had in his room. Thinking there is not much to learn from his oppnent and he would just stick to his plan he greeted Daniel wiht a smile and a bow. Daniel bowed back and the pair made their way into the area.</p>

         <p>It was hot, too hot. The moment they steped out Otto could feel his face starting to sweat, the crowd where shouting on their friends and now being down in the middle of it all he could hear just how loud the curved walls of the area made the crowd. Otto opend with castin lightning cloak, lightning covered his entire robe but would only react on contact so it was of no threat to Daniel with that the match began. Daniel opened with a manaball which gathered in the palm of his hand and looked to be made of mud and earth, before he had much time to debate Daniel's element it was flug towards him at great speed. Casting wall of lightning infrount of him, lightning bolts stuck up from the ground 1m in height. Otto ducked and the ball his the lighting bolts and broke appart, the pieces of the ball exploded out in all directions some of them hitting into Ottos arm and  side. He had lost alot of mana and some hp in that exchange and Daniel had come out ontop. Gripping his spear and casting Charged Charge his body felt lighting crawling all over his skin his muscles twitched from the stimulus and he shot foward and great speed. Daniel taken back by this sudden change summoned an earthen 1m wall infrount of himself, which Otto just jumped over easily with his increased speed. He lunged the spear into Daniel's center and cast Shocking touch, the spell worked by releasing lighting-mana from his fingers but as he had hoped the lighting ran the length of the spear and entered Daniel's body. The last thing Otto remebered was the great pain in his feet and legs as a 1m earthen spike shot out of the ground and sent him flying. The match was over.</p>

         <p>Waking in a bed unfamilia to him with bright white light shining into his eyes, Otto reached his hand to cover his face from the brightness and looked around. In a bed to the right of him sitting up eating red grapes was Daniel. Turning towards Otto and smiling.</p>

         <p>Daniel - "Congradulations on your win, I'm Daniel the first earth mage to lose to a lightning mage this year."</p>

         <p>Feeling awkuard Otto responded "Sorry about that, but how is it my win if I ended up in here also?"</p>
         
         <p>Daniel - "First to bring the oppoents health to 10 points wins, after you lowered my health to 10 points so the spell that activated after although lowering your health to 10 points also means I came secound."</p>

         <p>Otto - "Oh I see, sorry again. Can I ask, why does our health stop at 10 points?"</p>

         <p>Daniel - "Don't be sorry your prize is to do that again, you where my final match and I don't plan on going though that pain again any time soon. You don't know? Teacher should of told you, during a duel your health stops at 10 points so no one dies. If you want to know more then that you'll have to ask professor Farald he's an expert on it."</p>

         <p>Otto - "Thank you, I think I must of missed when we were taught that. How did your first match go?"</p>

         <p>Daniel - "Easy win, guess that's why I was so confident going in. This will teach me."</p>

         <p>Otto soon left the infimary and went back to his room to rest after being granted leave for the afternoon. The show he put on today proberly caught some attention using a spear to get shocking touch's range to increase. Any mage in the know however would of noticed that shocking touch alone would never of K.O. Daniel in one hit but all he could do was hope non of the students worked out his plan. Trying to formulate a new plan Otto went top side, on the top of the cliff was an area set out for training, or at least that what it had become. Otto was trying to push his lighting-mana into the spear and throw it, the only trouble was, the lighting-mana he wrapped around the spear didn't travel with the spear, the spear flew and the lighting mana just disipated. "There must of been a skill for this I don't have yet or missed.. I am out of spell points anyway."</p>

         <p>Ralsan - "If you have a spare spell point and force it enough you can learn a skill that way. Would look cool to see a lighting spear."</p>

         <p>Otto - "Hey, yeah it would of but I don't have any skill points left."</p>

         <p>Ralsan - "Please tell me you at least got discharge?"</p>

         <p>Otto - "No, I thought since it drains so much mana I would just pass out, so I didn't get it."</p>

         <p>Ralsan - "From what I saw you passed out anyway. I just came up to tell you its dinner, we are eating togeather while we give each other advice."</p>

         <p>Otto - "Ah, i'll be down shortly, thank you."</p>

<h4>The fifth day.</h4>
<p>Otto again entered the armory and debated on which weapon to pick, this time the other students in the armoy where curious about what he would do. Trying to ignore their stares by telling himself this is just 5 minutes of fame they will all forget about me soon enough. Otto picked up a warhammer, the thing was easily 30kg, no mage in the right mind would use such a weapon, no normal mage could even wield such a thing. Smiling to himself internally with and idea of how to act in this battle Otto took his place and waited.</p>

<p>"Otto & Kaja make your war to the arena."</p>

<p>Kajs was a little shorter then Otto, dark blonde hair and dark blue eyes, but the most noticable thing about her was a large wooden sheild in her left hand.</p>

<p>Otto - "How did you know you would be fighting me?"</p>

<p>Kaja - "I didn't just figured some other punk would try it, if I don't need it I can drop it if I do need I got it. Although that is not a spear." she pointed to the warhammer balanced on Otto's sholder.</p>

<p>Otto - "No, no it is not" he replied with a smile.</p>

<p>They made their way into the arena, bowed to each other and the match started. Kaja kept her wand hidden behind the shield and when she casted fireballs she moved the shield and released them at Otto who was trying his best to avoid them enterely. Taunting him as he danced. "You'll have to fight back pretty boy or I'll burn your hair off."</p>

<p>"Stop shotting me and I might" Otto relied moving aside of yet antoher fireball, while he was saving mana his stamnia would not last much longer he would start to become slow. Using Charged charge Otto dashed across the field and slamed his warhammer into Kaja's sheild, although it helped she struggled under the force and fell down. The shield had reduced the attack from 72% of her hp to just damaging 34%, it would take 3 attacks to take her down instead of 2. While down but not out, Kaja shot a fireball into Ottos stomach. -25% health. Good thing she keeps using fireball and nothing else, Otto moved to swing his warhammer again, this time without charged charge he resorted to using shocking touch but he only managed 28% of her health. Kaja struck back with a flamethrower spell putting Ottos clothes on fire, dropping and rolling away Otto lost his warhammer on the ground to put out the fire, -25% again.</p>

<p>Kaja - "What will you do now, without your toy? Time to become ash and smoke." Kaja raised her wand and the ground started to burn, Ottos feet strated to sweat, she was going to set him on fire from below this time. Too far away to hit her with anything useful all my spells only have 1m range. Chainlightning. Otto stuck the warhammer with chainlightning, the lightning hit the warhammer and bounced into Kaja -14%, the sudden shock and pain caused her to lose concentration and Otto took his chance and dashed for her.</p>

<p>Grabbing the warhammer he felt a sudden burning sessions in his side, -28%. She hit me with another one of thoes damnned fireballs. Screaming as he turned to use charged charge he accelerated, Kaja seeing this coming enveloped herself in fire-mana as he slamed his warhammer down into her shield, the fire mana had increased her defences 22% dammage. Thinking to himself if she was level 14 or less she would be dead. -35%. The fire cloak had stuck him as he came into melee rang, His health had reached the final 10 first, his blow had landed moments after leaving her with 2% hp. He had lost.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the battle, she must of been at least level 15, would of put her hp at 250 unless she put any points into vitality in which case she might be a lower level. Unable to do anything about it now the reflection was a form of self improvement rarther then an excuse for his loss, he would reflect on what happend, what he should of done and grow from this.</p>

<p>Bowing to Kaja, and her to him they left the arena and returned their weapons, it was nice to not have been knocked out this time. walking back to watch the rest of the duels though the day he got an unexpected visit from his teacher.</p>

<p>Lubin - "Rarther intresting approach, Strength in a match between mages."</p>

<p>Otto - "Did not think that would slip by you, do you disapprove?"</p>

<p>Lubin - "No not really, I trust you have read though the historys at least once? You are not the first mage to try strength and magic. I'm sure you won't be the last but it is very uncommon during peace times."</p>

<p>Otto - "Why is it uncommon during times of peace?"</p>

<p>Lubin - "The method of strength and magic is one usually only taken after level 50, to do it so early would only happen when you have many types of enimies, a hard road before level 50 mind you. I just came to give some advice, Historys: Battle-mages, Fighter-Mage, Inquisitor, Mage-Tanks are all a good place to start. There are more however, slightly more unsual methods, in the main libuary there is also records from a necomancer and a deathknight. Not usually given out to first year students, but usual first year students dont put points into strength."</p>

<p>Otto - "Thank you sir, but why would you go out of your way to do all this forme?"</p>

<p>Lubin - "Nothing personal, it's just my job, guide students to a path that they want to take, once they find their path help them traverse it. Don't mitsake this for me picking favrouts I am just doing what is expected of me. You may take your leave for the day if you want, I believe you have some reading to do."</p>

<p>Otto - "Yes sir, thank you sir" And with that Otto went to the libuary while the other first year students where in the arena to read up on the necromancer and the deathknight. </p>


          <!-- Tisiel's door -->

          <p>Having gotten Tisiel's letter Otto was standing infrount of the giant circular door waiting for her. Tisiel soon arrived looking like she had stayed up all night again.</p>
          <p>Otto - "So you made a big break though?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yes, I am sure we can open this door"</p>
          <p>Otto - "How?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "You just have to take this ring, get down on one knee and ask me to marry you. Simple right?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "The door shall forever remain a mystory, no one will ever know what was behind it. Shame really."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - puffing out her cheeks "It was just a joke, but seriosuly though we can open the door, we just have to read this passage togeather outloud and combine the wand with the ring."</p>
          <p>Otto  - "Alright let's get this over with, these better not be wedding vows."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "It was a joke.."</p>

          <p>Togeather the pair read off a translated version of the passage from the book, the sounds dont fit quite togeather as they should but still the doors syombols glow red like the ring. As instructed Otto places the wand though the ring Tisiel is holding and they both pass mana though, sure enogh the circles begang to rotate. Soon the door seem to disappear like it was never there, confused the pair just look at each other.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Hold up, I had to put my wand in your ring? I bet this is a sex dungon after all."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ohh, how about a wager. If its a sex dungon I will buy you dinner. If not, you buy you dinner."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Aha you are on, now get your ass in the creepy sex dungon."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Good thing no one else is around.."</p>

          <p>Stepping inside they find stairs leading down into darkness, lighting up mana balls to float around them they make their way down to the bottom. At the bottom was a small dark room, it contained a desk book shelves and a chest of draws. There were lots of books, a large blue orb giving off a little light and skulls. Many, many skulls, they lined the book shelves with books leaning against them, they where a few on the desk, the draws in the chess where full of skulls.</p>

          <div class="pop">Room<img class="popOut" src="./images/wizroom.jpg" height="400px" alt="Room"></div>

          <p>Otto - "You owe me dinner."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - ".. This is NOT a sex dungon!"</p>
          <p>Otto - "I dunno, mood lighting, sexy skulls"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Phahaha, you freak. Get looking for loot."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yeah alright"</p>

          <p>While Tisiel was looking though the books Otto whiped out his wand and looked for magic items. Most of the objects in the room remaind as they where, except from the orb the only items in the room which glowed where the qill left on the table, a wizards hat screwed up in a corner, a pendent ontop of the chess of draws and one of the skulls on the book shelf. Taking these items and placing them on the desk togeather when Tisiel had finished looking though the books and taking the ones she likes in a small pile on the desk they decided to go though what they had found.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Think you can work out what these items do?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Well yeah, given time I am sure I can do a few of them, lets take these things out of here and back to my room we can go over what we have."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yeah I don't want to spend too long down here."</p>

          <p>Otto - "lets go over what we have, and how do we split it up?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ah, this is where I betray you, and steal all the loot for myself. Using the ill gotten goods I get propelled forward and become a huge master of the realm"</p>
          <p>Otto - "What are the chances that any of this stuff is even useful to you? And like you'd betray me, you'd have no one to join you in your sex dungon then."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "IT IS NOT A SEX DUNGON! .... I am not sure what it is yet, looked like a study, private place to work, but why? I am sure I will get to the bottom of though though my studies. Anyway at this level it's less about finding something helpbut but building myself around what we have found."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I am sure you will find out what was going on down there and drag me back in soon, honestly if you really wanted the items I would rarther have a trust worthy partner then one or two magic items I am not sure I can even use."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ohh, you trust me? That's new. I'll tell you what they do, well what I know then we take turns taking one each?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Mmm that's more then fair, honestly the exams coming up and arena matches I am sure I will need someone to watch my back."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ahhh stop talking you're making things awkuard."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Starting with the wand and ring that opened the door. I am unsure what else they can do but they seem to be syombols of the people that made the door, graveyard and lived in the ruined academy. I'd like to keep studying them..."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Taking two already? It's fine, we might need them in the future I won't give you a hard time you can keep them without it counting as one of yours."</p>
          <p>Tisiel nod's and continues - "Now the Kings crown. It's the Crown of the Dammed. A rare piece, increases your magic and decreases your charisma, aswell as increasing the number of undead you can control."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Creepy."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yes well, perfect for a necromancer or a mage who just does not care for their appearance and others."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Ah, so it's perfect for you?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Tsst, I acctually do want it, it is intresting but I do care how I look thank you very much."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Mmm sorry that was too far, I think you and Reingard will make a beautiful couple."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I.. What? Why do you say that!?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Knew it. Now keep going before he gets the wrong idea about why I keep coming into your room alone with you."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Tsst, you. The kings ring, is an basic undead control ring increaseing your control over the undead."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yours."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Thank you. The queens tiara, it's called Queen's pawn, it comes with the skill animate stone. That explains the things that attacked us in the grave yard."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Her ring, it gives a little strength to the wearer."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Finally the daughters coin, who though more research I am not sure is there daughter at all. I am not even sure if they are related and this coin is a mystory to me, can't find any references to coins like it, and I cannot tell what kind of magic it cointains."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Hmmm kind of junky items then? The tiara sounds expensive maybe it would be better to sell it?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah I don't feel like you are wrong, its so niche. It's not like we have a stone mason to make use humanoid statue's. Anyway the stuff from the room. The pendent increase your magic much more then normal items but reduces your strength it's really popular amoung mages if you take it with the queens ring there will be no negative effects, can't have you been to small."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Aha, I'll take them even if you are trying to get rid of that ring."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Hehe you saw though that. Next is the skull-"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yours."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "It might be amazing."</p>
          <p>Otto - "... No one is going to talk to me if I walk around with a skull."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Why do you care if people talk to you?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Do you want the skull or not?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Fine, I wanted it anyway. Now the Hat increases your magic. It's acctually pretty good."</p>
          <p>Otto - "And the quill?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Come on you don't want the quill."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yeah, I want the hat but what does the quill do."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ah, it helps your chances when eteching encantments on items"</p>
          <p>Otto - "I get the feeling you came out of this better then me"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "There is still the coin and tiara."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I'll take the coin, you can sell the tiara and buy me dinner, I'm sure I was right about that sex dungon."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I will stab you to death with this quill if you menction that again."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Hehe, fine let's go eat. I would like to know what was going on down there though."</p>

          
          <h4>Dinner</h4>

          <p>Otto - "Tisiel it had sliped my mind, but I took notes on the history of these two mages from the main libuary, I think you might find them more useful then me reflecting on whats happened."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "On whats happened?" Looking at the titles and quickly skimming the contense of the book. "You know, you might be right, this looks exsactly like the kind of inspireation I need for myself, mind if I copy this?"</p>

          <p>Otto - "Go ahead, but don't summon skeletons and leave them in my room."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Ah that was my whole plan!"</p>

          <h3>Missions</h3>
          <h4>Sign up</h4>
          <p>It was finally mission day, after so long of waiting first years where finally in a posistion to leave the safety of the academy and go into the world, both inside of the academy grounds which seem vast with many areas totally unexplored and the world beyond the portal. It was also a good way to make money.</p>

          <p>The missions where not the adventure thill ride Otto had expected, one of the mission slips said "Lightning mage wanted: To put manaballs around bathhouse to keep mosquitoes away." He had ended up taking this one, he had no idea what mosquitoes where but at least he would be helping someone. Tisiel's mission of going though old junk and decrypting them seemed to suit her, Reingard had even joined her as a bodyguard. Otto left though the portal back to Banderdam, this mission would take him though Chihal and down to Savigal a port town on the border with Huonhia. Since his ID now had him marked as a combat mage he was able to join a merchant group heading to Chihal.</p>

          <p>Sitting in the back of a wagon the trip was mostly uneventful, Chihal sat between 3 ports so natureally had a large market place. There were no walls, no castle and seemed very peaceful, it was far from any border conflict with the monsters down south even if Huonhia ever tried to invade it was unlikly they would push this far to assult Chihal it could not serve any strategic importance. The town it's self was rarther small, there were few farms outside tended by mages who had retired from the academy and inside the town was a few dwellings, tavern, inn and the market place. It took 9 hours to arrive they had stopped for lunch but the time was still very good. It would take a further 6 hours at least to reach Savigal so Otto decided to book a room at the inn then have a look around the market place.</p>

          <!-- Inn -->

          <!-- Market place with strange goods. -->
          <p>The market place was selling all kind of oddities with merchants traveling between ports and cities stopping off here they opened shop from their wagons, wands, weapons, armor, skeletons, mana stone, mounts, there was even one merchant selling long metal tubes with a wooden handle, he claimed they where wands of explosion magic but said he had no idea how they worked.</p>
          <!-- journey -->
          <p>Setting off from Chihal the weather was colder then it was yestoday. Without the wagon to sit in today would leave him tired. Wrapping the robe around himself to keep the wind off he walked along the path with the rainforest on either side. There were a few others travling also but most of the merchants and others where heading to Banderdam or the two larger ports in the area. Savigal would be a small port it seems. After walking for 3 hours Otto needed to pee, walking into the rainforest just off the path to do it in peace.</p>
          <!-- The dead forigner -->
          <p>While relaving himself he soon noticed hanging above him from the tree was a deadman. Pulling his robe back around himself and grabbing his warhammer Otto span around looking about. Nothing. Closer inspection would show he had been dead awhile, his flesh was mostly gone, the eyes removed it seemed the animals had long been at his body, the smell was bad but thats not what had Otto's attention. Tangled in the vines the man was wearing strange clothes, even strange for a nobel, a blue jacket with gold trim, but it had no hood and didnt feel like a woolen robe. The cuffs and sholders where not sewn into the sleaves but rarther left to hand over the top. The mans face was strange too, but hard to judge a man whos been picked at by the birds. Looking down on the ground some of the mans belongings where here, strange purple coins, a wand, looked like the merchants explosion wands back in Chihal, if it was though it was faulty as no explosion had happend around here. There where papers and food. Otto decided to move the items into his bag as the mans bag was torn.</p>

          <p>"I'll take them back to the academy with me maybe Tisiel can make sense of these things." setting back on the path to Savigal Otto made his way for another hour before coming across another body, a merchant he had seen earlier that day. This body was fresh, still bleeding out but long dead. He was not a well to do merchant, he had no wagon or body guards but was travling with others. Seems they had no robbed him as his trinkets and food lay scattered about the path and into the forest.</p>
        <!-- Danger -->

        <p>Getting closer to the body Otto could see the dead body of a large wolf in the direction the blood went into the forest, the wolf was almost 2 meters tall when stood on all fours and over 3 meters long. The problem was there was only one wolf body, even Otto knew wolves don't attack alone normally. The other merchants where no where to be seen, prehaps the pack is still chasing them? They might double back for the kill they got, I should get away from here.</p>

        <p>I left at a brisk pace down the road, since the merchants didn't come back towards me I must assume they made their way down here so I should keep a look out. Soon enough I came across the other merchants, arranged around the wagon with small gaps in their line. Unable to see into the forest the only monsters I could make out where two large wolves similar size to the one back with the dead merchant and one smaller about half their size cloestest to my position. Unsure of what to do for awhile I just stayed still, soon enough a large man in the group shouted towards me. "If you stand alone they will target you and take you out, run quick and get into the group." at his shout I ran, I ran as fast as I could, not having invested many points into dexterity it was not easy as I used the strength I had invested into my stats to pump my legs as hard as I could. Soon enough the wolves noticed me, the small one charged towards me as the merchant's and body guards intercepted the larger wolves taking this oppertunity to attack them. Seeing the wolf run towards me with its fangs out scared me. I gripped tight around the warhammer and launched byself with Charged Charge, my legs twitched with lighting, my speed shot up over that 1 meter gap. Launching myself warhammer first into the beast it hit the ground with a whimper, blood and fangs splattered over the floor. The hammer has caused more damage then the lighting. A normal baby wolf would of had it's whole head caved in, my attack did 72%. The large man who had called me over stabbed a spear into the wolf as it tried to get back up. It would never get back up.</p>
        
        <p>He ran to help with the two larger wolves, I tried to stike one of them with a lightning strike, 0.05% damage. One of the largers wolves was slayn the other ran bleeding back into the forest. I was later told by Giselher the large body guard who speared the smaller wolf that the large wolves where between level 20 and 29. They had high magic defences and often made pray of magical or weak humans. I don't know what the large wolf dropped by the small wolf dropped a pair of gloves, Giselher gave them to me saying I did most of the damage anyway and he was supprised a mage would have so much strength. I gladdly accepted it would be my first monster drop. To get to Savigal I decided to join their group just encase the last wolf made a return.</p>

        <li>Hands:<font color="darkgrey">Mutt's Mits</font> Magic defence +1.</li>

        <h4>Savigal</h4>
        <p>Savigal port was so small it did not even have a market worth a menction, just ships and merchants setting up on wooden crates or out the back of the wagons, no real stalls. The port had 2 ships in dock, a small cog with one sail. The other was a Hatalia ship, a balinger with a single mast with many holes for oars although they where closed right now, I could only tell it was from Hatalia because of the flag flown from the rear of the ship, it was unlikely they built the ship themselves, Hatalia's navy might be as large as Aldens but they where a much larger country. Hatalian's broguht their ships from Chalbia.</p>

        <p>I made my way though the small market place buying fruits and rations for the trip back, I could make the trip in 2 days and rest at a town each night so I did not need much, but when travling and with the funds to do so it' nice to try new things. After shopping I went to the office building, normally a small town like this would use the village hall for any government administation, but since Savigal was a port town capable of being used during times of war it had a government office building here. All I had to do was take my ID and mission slip in and in return they informed the bathhouse. While I waited for the sun go to down since the mission was to take place just after the sun sets I rested in the rarther large taven.</p>

        <h4>The bath houses</h4>
          <p>Just after the sun set I made my way to the bath house, waiting for me was an elderly woman, haunched over a small cane in her hand she smiled and waved towards me. I waved back, my robe must of given me away.</p>

          <p>"Must be the boy they sent from the academy, first year am I right?"</p>

          <p>"Yes but how did you know?"</p>

          <p>"You robe, pure black. They will give you a new one when you get back, thing is it embrasses the academy if a mage with colors dies on their first mission."</p>

          <p>"Oh I see.."</p>

          <p>"Don't worry the only danger to your mission is making it all the way out here, the task of putting up mana-balls should be simple really. Follow me I just need you to put lightning-mana balls inside these stone totems. Should keep thoes damnned things away. What you doing back there don't be shy the bathhouse is empty tonight."</p>

          <p>"Ah yes sorry, the sign said ladies so.."</p>

          <p>"It's empty get in here."</p>

          <p>"Yes Ma`am."</p>

          <p>The mission was really short, after putting a few lighting mana balls and chatting to the bathhouse lady for awhile I found out the mana-balls had gone out because the mana stones keeping them active had run out. I also learned mosquitoes are small bugs that bite you, and it is really itchy! The cure however is a 40 degree bath ... This has to be the best perk of the job.</p>

          <p>While relaxing in the bath, I could feel the warmth move into my toes, it felt like the warmth was moving into my bones, my muscles relaxed and time just seem to pass by...</p>

          <p>"AHHHHHHHHH"</p>

          <p>"Huh?" I jumped up and grabbed for my warhammer, the cold soon gripped by body after leaving the warm waters. As I looked towards the scream I noticed it was a girl wrapped in a towel, soon her mother came to her and I remebered I was naked.</p>

          <p>"Ah you're still in here? I didn't think you'd still be in here oh deary me put a towel around yourself gave the girl a fight" the bathouse woman seemed to be enjoying the mischief she had made. Is she so bored as to set me up like this!?</p>

          <p>After appologising to the girl and her mother and the many other women on the way out I made my way over to the tarvern. Tonight I would drown that embrassment in drink.</p>
          
        <h4>side quest</h4>
        <p>Just as I was getting my first drink the bar tender handed me a note, on the front was my name in scribbled hand writing. Inside was a baddly drawn map with a line from the tavern into the nearby forest with a large X on it. "What the hell is this?" I asked no one inparticular.</p>

        <p>"Can't say I understand it, but looked like a map to me."</p>

        <p>"Mmm yeah thanks, who gave it to you?"</p>

        <p>"Bathous.."</p>

        <p>"Yeah I'm not going."</p>

        <p>"Isan't she your employeer?"</p>

        <p>"...It's almost like you don't want my money.. Fine I'm going.."</p>

        <p>"Take care of yourself, no doubt she's up to no good."</p>

        <p>"...Yeah"</p>

        <p>Making my way back into the village, past the bathhouse and up into the forest, not too far into the forest was a small house, walking up the stairs and knocking on the small door I wanted, soon enough the bathouse women opned the door. "Ah good you got my message"</p>

        <p>"Bearly it looked like a childs drawing."</p>

        <p>"Well it is, Mia here drew it."</p>

        <p>It was the girl from the bathouse, I could not be more embrassed. "Ah sorry about earlier." I touched the back of my head and tried to smile. Mia just looked away with a red face, seems she dose not like me. I wouldn't like me either..</p>

        <p>"So, why did you call me out here?"</p>

        <p>"Ah well I know it's not part of the request I sent to the academy, but would you light a mana-ball here also? Just to help out an old women, no one wants to be bitten by thoes nasty thing."</p>

        <p>"Yeah alright." I lit up the stone totem from the inside.</p>

        <p>"Mia is my grandaughter. Not that you asked, but she is a Mage and is going to the academy next year."</p>

        <p>"I'm sure she will enjoy it there and learn much, just write ahead in advance and ask not to be put into the cliffside."</p>

        <p>"Well ofcouse everyone knows that."</p>

        <p>My eyebrow twitched at the comment..</p>

        <p>"What I really was hoping was that you could talk to Mia and tell her about the academy it's been so long since I went I am sure it is nothing like it was before."</p>

        <p>"Ah okay, I guess I can, as a way to say sorry..."</p>

        <p>"That's the spirit, I'll get you two some drinks and food, I hope you like mangos."</p>

        <p>This is going to be so awkuard. In the end Mia was easy to talk to, since we were almost the same age and I had only just joined the academy and she was so intrested in it we had alot to talk about. I ended up sleeping there after Mia went home, at least I saved the cost of a room, I would head back early in the morning and try to make it to Chihal and look around the market by the afternoon.</p>
        
        <p>I ended up having to give Mia my address so she could send me mail if she had more questions about the academy, when they found out I was staying in the cliffside they pitied me abit, but if I'm honest since day one I have enjoyed staying there. I waved good bye and set off along the path to Tisiel.</p>

        <p>On the jorney back I saw more guards then usual, maybe because of yestodays attack. I managed to make it back to the market by just after midday I really made good timing. In the market I managed to find a book with strange markings on it, the same strange markings I saw with Tisiel on the door in the cliffside. I knew I had to buy it, the merchant only had odd and unique items which all seem to be of little or no use other then being odd. In the end I had managed to buy the book in exchange some of the coins I had found on the forigner, he seemed much more intrested in thoes then real money.</p>

        <p>Staying the night again, and heading to Banderdam in the morning was my plan. After I was finished at the market however I was approached by Giselher who was escorting a merchant group asking if I would travel with them to Banderdam tonight. While it was risky to travel at night, I would be with the other guards and make some more money. I took them up on the offer.</p>

        <p>That night I walked next to the wagon along with Giselher, he told he had been working as a guard for hire for over 10 years since he left the military academy. Since the attack yestoday the merchants would be hireing more but the chance of attack was less, usually when one strong monster is taken down in an area it takes awhile before another appears. As if to prove him wrong only 15 minutes after he said it we came across some monsters.</p>

        <p>Skeletons. This better not be Tisiel's doing was all I could think. The battle was not to my advantage initially, skeletons had a slight natural resistance for lightning. I soon found however they where very weak to my warhammer, I soon gave up on using spells on the skeletons directly and opted to save my mana to charge, and shock them to create an opening.</p>

        <p>55% dammage per swing, swing, shock, swing. Repeating this over and over until we had killed 50 skeletons between us. "What level are they Giselher?"</p>

        <p>"Around level 10, skeletons are quite common here with the jungle to the south and academy to the north. These are mage skeletons they came from the north and they are really weak. It's their numbers that will take you down."</p>

        <p>"Anything good drop?"</p>

        <p>"Nah skeletons at level 10, you'll get a few bones.. if you are into that kind of thing."</p>

        <p>"Well, I have a friend who might be intrested..."</p>

        <p>"Forgot you are from the academy for a moment, take them they are worthless really and I feel wrong being around them."</p>

        <p>"Ah yes thank you, honestly I can't say I want to hold onto them for too long."</p>

        
        <!-- Town - Talk to Leon and his sister, who gives Otto the mask he found in the forest. -->
        <p>After we made it to Banderdam I thanked Giselher, got paid and headed to the shop Leon worked at. Just as he said he was now an apprentice shop keeper, he was behind a counter thinking about something hard while looking down at some papers and a large book. I walked up to him and knocked on the desk "Shouldn't the shop keeper greet the costomers?"</p>

        <p>"I am so sorry si...Hey you came!" Leon wore a bright smile but the frown lines still remained on his forehead, whatever was troubling him had not left his mind.</p>

        <p>"You working hard? You seem a little stressed."</p>

        <p>"Ahaha no no, just learning to keep the books all this maths hurts my brain. I am enjoying it really its a good challenge. So they finally let you out of the academy? Why don't you stay for dinner? My sister is a really good cook!"</p>

        <p>"I'll take you up on that, but I'll buy the ingredidents I just got paid and you have work to do. I'll come back with supplies and you can show me the way to your house."</p>

        <p>"Ah really? That sounds like a plan!"</p>

        <p>As agreed I went shopping for fresh vegtables and meat, I did just get paid and if I took any money back to the academy with me they would take it as I owed them a debt. It's not like I could spend all of the money though, they sent me on a mission and knew how much I would be paid for that at least. Arriving back at the shop I had left a over an hour ago Leon was still inside, it seemed that clocking off even at after sundown was a favour to the shop keeper he owed. We walked and talked as we made our way to Leons place, while it was inside the walls of Banderdam it was not near the market but across the otherside of town in what appeared to be where the working class of the city livied. The houses were not run down and decryped but there where children out playing, the streets where even clean. I decided it best not ask I might come off as rude assumeing it would be dirty and run down. Once we made it to a three story building and walked up to the 3rd floor, inside was Leon's sister. Mouse brown hair like her brother but longer, she was smaller and had alot less facial hair. Her cheeks still contained a bit of baby fat it seems, but there was no doubt who was in charge.</p>

        <p>"You said you would be home late, I haven't started didnner and you bring home a stranger?"</p>

        <p>"Relax Milly this is Otto, I told you about him he saved my life coming back though the forest, he brought food and I was hoping you would be able to cook..."</p>

        <p>"And what will you two be doing while I'm cooking!?"</p>

        <p>"I err.. But he's our guest."</p>

        <p>Otto - "Nice to meet you Milly I am Otto, I'll help you cook, It's not my first time and Leon can clean up."</p>

        <p>Leon looked towards me puzzled but Milly just agreed, it seemed she had grown quickly with her parents only dieing the year before I think it was. The food was good and I managed to catch up with Leon & Milly was good company too. I told him of the academy and my mission, the strange place that was Savigal. Leon told me of the strange items customers often brought in, apprerntly more so now then ever.</p>

        <p>"Ah I had been meaning to thank you more for helping me get back home alive, I didn't really have anyting to give at the time, but recently I traveled though the forest guiding a Huonhia traveler and came across this." Leon placed a bone white mask on my lap, it had large stag like antlers sticking out of the top but it looked to all be on piece no joins or breaks and all of it bone white, when I touched it, it felt like the bones I had recieved from the skeletons, but somehow harder. The mask had two eye holes and stopped just short of where your mouth would be, on the forehead was a red syombol. It was not one I knew.</p>

        <p>"Ah truth be told, I am not too sure what it does, I showed it to my master but he said to keep it it was not something he could sell, it's not a mana item he said. Apprerntly it is from Leika appart of their old religion."</p>

        <p>"I can't say I know anything about it either, but I know just who to ask, thank you Leon it might not be worth money but it really intrestes me. Thank you."</p>

        <p>Milly - "Just glad you accepted it really, that thing has been creeping me out the whole time it was here, like it was going to come to life or something."</p>

        <p>"Ahahaha she's just exaggerating if it was a cursed item the faith would of come by now."</p>

        <p>"I'm sure it's not cursed, everyone knows cursed items are rare, thank you again Leon"</p>

        <p>Soon after I headed back to the academy, it was nice to see they where doing well but I really had to get to sleep in my own bed.</p>
       
          <li>Gained:<font color="darkgrey"> Unknown mask.</font> ???.</li>
        <!-- Give bones, coins and weird wand to bone woman -->
        <p>Almost as if she had been waiting for me Tisiel opened the door to the cliffside before I even managed to speak the password.</p>

        <p>"Glad to see you are not dead, come in I found things on my trip."</p>

        <p>"Nice to see you survived too." Coming inside I saw Reingard who waved to me as I came in, he was sorting though some bones of some kind of animal.</p>

        <p>"Didn't take you for a necromancer Reingard."</p>

        <p>"Tisiel's bones not mine, just really hate how she leaves them all in a pile, I had to put them in some kind of order."</p>

        <p>"Ah, well. You're really gonna hate this..." I placed a bag full of bones down next to him.</p>

        <p>"Tisiel you brought back bones for me?"</p>

        <p>"Skeleton bones, level 10. They attacked us on the way back to Banderdam, I was going to ask if they where your doing."</p>

        <p>"No no, I didn't have any bones like this before so it was not me. Sounds like there is another mage at the academy going the same route as me, but they must be a second year I don't have the mana for all these."</p>

        <p>"Well there was close to 50 of them, I don't remeber all too well, I am quite tired but these where the only thing they dropped before dispearing."</p>

        <p>"Oh I also got you something, hold on it's in my room I'll go get it!"</p>

        <p>"Ah take these with you, bag of strange coins with strange marks on them, thought it was more your area of expertise then mine. Also this." I reached into my bag I kept at my side and handed over the book I had brought in the market 2 days ago. Her eye's lit up. Without a word Tisiel bowed lightly and ran stright to her room.</p>

        <p>"A book? she's going to be gone for days now."</p>

        <p>"You two grew close."</p>

        <p>"Ah yeah, I mean we did share our first mission togeather."</p>

        <p>"I'm glad, keep her safe Reingard, and i'm sure she will keep you happy."</p>

        <p>"What's that mean?"</p>

        <p>"Here!"</p>

        <p>Before I could reply to Reingard Tisiel in some kind of inhuman speed had made it back panting and out of breath holding a pair of boots up to me.</p>

        <p>"You didn't have to run, and thank you." I picked the boots of her hands and they felt soft. The bottom felt spongy like damp moss without the wet feeling.</p>

        <p>"Ah because you have a lightning element I thought you should have absorbsion boots! My parents make them, they are not very popular but maybe if you become famous they will be!"</p>

        <p>"Ah thank you, what do they do?"</p>

        <p>"Ohh, they absorb a small amount of energy and release it to help you bounce! The idea was that you could move around in melee easier but the problem was the requirment is that you are a mage."</p>

        <p>"I will have to try them out in the morning, thank you Tisiel." I gave a light bow. "But I really have to sleep, sorry to be rude but it's been a long night." I left them to their studies? It matters not what they are doing and headed to my room.</p>

        <li>Gained:<font color="darkgrey"> Bouncy Boots.</font> Absorbs a small amount of energy when struck and releases it to help you bounce! .</li>

        <!-- Get invited to dinner -->
        <p>Arriving back in my room on my bed was a new robe and letter ontop with my name written atop, and the image of a stag as the water mark. Putting the letter to one side I held the robe up to get a look. It was black like the pervious robe but with mustard yellow trimming around the cuffs and hem. Truely not the best color. Opening the letter, it was an invite to the student staff dinner congradulations to the first years on offically making it a part of the academy.</p>

        <p>The only thing I wanted right now was sleep. Pushing all of this onto the desk removing my old robe, travled clothes, before I could even think to do anything else I felt as if the bed was sucking me in and off to sleep, I feel onto the bed and asleep before I could think of anything else.</p>

        <p>The next morning I doned my new robe, the color of the yellow was not any better then it had been when I was almost asleep. </p>
          
          <!-- Dinner - Staff and students -->
          <h3>Meet Tsuma as witch princess from Leikia.</h3>
          <p>Otto could not help but stop listining to the coversation, his eyes had been caught and his full attention was now directly focused the woman who had just walked though the door. Stunning smooth sholder length stright black hair, slightly tanned smooth skin, almond shaped eyes, as she looked around the room he could not help but admire how elgant and graceful she was moving about between the guests like a fairy. She had a slim waist and a beautiful dress, it was a deep blue and fitted against her curves. If he did not stop now he was going to be caught stareing.</p>

          <p>He excused himself as hastily has he could and made his way across the room to try and stike a coversation with her only to be caught by old professor Farald, I heared from young Daniel you where curious about how the duel system works. Unable to escape he had to hope he could find her later.</p>

          <p>To his luck and amazement there was a beautiful fairy-like goddess of a woman was still there, she had taken an intrest in their converstation. Using this oppertunity he introduced himself.</p>

          <p>"Hello, I am Otto a first year student, are you intrested in this topic also?"</p>
          <p>"Ah, yes. I am very much so. I am" she paused for a moment, "you can call me Tsuma."</p>
          <p>"Nice to meet you Tsuma, your accesent are you from Leika? It's very loverly."</p>
          <p>"Yes, I came here as an exchange, I am in my secound year here."</p>
          <p>"I must be off you two, if you need me for a longer disscussion please leave me a message at my office, its in the research department I imagine you haven't been there before but anyone else should be able to point you in the right direction, please excuse me."</p>
          <p>"Oh no not at all professor, thank you for your knolwedge." Both of the students gave a light bow as professor Farald made his way over to a group of other professors calling to him.</p>

          <p>"I believe the dinner is starting soon, would you like to join me?"</p>
          <p>"Ah that won't be possible the seats are arranged before hand."</p>
          <p>"How about a date? A short one, tonight after the dinner. I'd like to take you to a cafe and talk, I've never been to Leika so prehaps we can start there."</p>
          <p>"I..Yeah, I can do that. I'll wait for you under the autem tree on your right as you leave though the main door."</p>
          <p>"Perect."</p>

          <!-- Tsuma has magic cat that turns black at night, white in the day and has purple eyes. -->

          <!-- Call for dinner -->
          <p>Ding. Ding. Ding. "Please make your way into the dinning hall, name cards are at each place please find your own name card. A flag stands on each table you can match the flag to your invitation image."</p>

          <p>Inside the hall was numerious tables with flags standing proud above them. A large red and white flag with a black stag, this must be me. On the table where places for 10, no doubt I would be unable to converse with thoes places too far from myself. My place was to the right on the innnerside of the table to the hall, not that it mattered the otterside was still 4 tables away from the nearest wall. To my right Reingard would be sat and my left Ebba.</p>

          <p>pov Tisiel</p>
<!-- Weird skull talking thing - Tisiel -->
          <p>After having arrived back in my room from the dinner party I removed the grey satin dress, sholderless hour-glass shaped to fit my waist, flowing off my hips giving me gliding wings down to my calfs if I walked too quickly. The thought of one day being able to just glide up into the sky with nothing but my foot steps made me feel like a kid again playing at magic, the reality was that using mana was much more exserting then I had imagined in my make believe worlds.</p>

          <p>Slipping into my room wear and feeling much more like my self again, with my collections of tombs, bones, nick-nacks and skulls to greet me back into what I enjoyed most, solving the mystories they presented. Settling down into an old wooden chair by my study table, I always wrap my hands around the curved handle, old habbits.</p>

          <p>"Well it's not quite as orderly as my study but I approve."</p>

          <p>Stopping and looking around the room, I had to pause and wonder if I had gone crazy, prehaps a little drunk.</p>

          <p>"Down here"</p>

          <p>I shot out of my own skin, jumping up onto the chair. "Who is here!?"</p>

          <p>"Down here, I ontop of your books."</p>

          <p>".... The.. Skull!?" My eyes fixed to the skull on the books, nothing unsual about it really. It did not move, the jaw stayed in placed, no eyes appeared in the sockets. There was a small amount of magical energy given off, it seemed no different from any other magic item.</p>

          <p>"Your first time meeting a sealed spirit?"</p>

          <p>"....Yes?"</p>

          <p>"Ahaha, well you seem like a smart girl, what do you think I am?"</p>

          <p>"Did... Someone trap your spirit into this skull? Was it your skull?.."</p>

          <p>"Well you are sharp. Yes my spirit was bound to my skull as part of my peoples funeral process. It was not a common process because the materials needed are rarther rare, so it is reserved for only thoes who could afford it. I think the results speak for themselves, I am dead but not gone from this plane."</p>

          <p>"Can you still use magic? Can you move? How long have you been dead?"</p>

          <p>"I suppose these are normal questions since it is your first time. Very well, I cannot use magic directly I would need a medium to act though or a source of mana which I am attached to. I cannot move. Hmm hard to say really, I continued as I am currnetly for a few civilizations before being left inside that witches study."</p>
          
          <p>"A few civilizations? Not years? Or centries?"</p>

          <p>"Yes, I mean 5 in total if I include my own. It looks like you have found items from some of them."</p>

          <p>"This is alot to take in.. So the study became your second tomb? What about your first?"</p>

          <p>"Oh, Don't think it has escaped me that most of the items here are taken from the tombs of the dead. Trying to raid my tomb? This is my resting place, this skull. My people did not believe that we took anything physical into the next life."</p>

          <p>"I could tell you about the location of another tomb if that is what your intrest is. The civilization that took over from my own buried their dead in pyramid shaped tombs. First the person who had died, then followed by their servants, guards and what ever else they would be taking to their next life with them."</p>

          <p>Unable to resist, I spent the whole night chatting to a skull, well the person bond to the skull. Gwrtheyrn was his name but since it was a bit of a mouthful we agreed to call him Vortigern, not much better but he seemed fussy about what he would be called. I managed to copy down to a rough map of where the tomb should be.</p>

          <!-- Arena --> 
          <p>Todays lesson started with an announcement, there would be arena team matches, thoes who where training to be non-combat mages did not need to join. The combat mages where expected to join, it was a good time to be noticed by merchant comapnies, mercany groups & most importantly dukes. The first year matches where put on between secound year matches which where the main draw of the arena matches. It would still be good to stand out infrount of these people if you wanted to work with them in the future.</p>

          <p>First things first he would need 3 teams mates. They must all be combat mages & first years. The first person I could think of was Reingard. He was the only other house mate I had talked to before that was a combat mage. Ralsan wanted to become a farmer, Tisiel was not made for combat, she would one day fight though skeleton warriors but no time soon. Shrorlei dispite meeting her I have no had time to talk to.</p>

          <p>I decided I had to see if Reingard knew anyone else.</p>

          <p>"So, you are telling me you have an older brother in the academy, yet you still ended up in the cliffside?"</p>

          <p>"I might have an older brother, but that dosen't mean he likes me.Anyway the point is we can recruit other people at the arena."</p>

          <p>"I mean, I guess that will work if we see what role they want to be and make a team around that. Speaking of what are you good at?"</p>

          <p>"So you asked me to make a team without knowing what I was good at?"</p>

          <p>"Guarding. Just wanted to see if you thought it was something else."</p>

          <p>"No, I know my strengths, I will be the tank for the party. But what about you Otto?"</p>

          <p>"Melee damage, and some support."</p>

          <p>That same day we went to the area to pick up some new members.</p>
          
          <h4>Recruitment</h4>
          <p>The arena was the same one we went to for the duels, while the arena had be packed back then it was much lighter now, with students standing around chatting and making posters and signs to try and recruit some new memebrs. Reingard suggested we try asking around thoes trying to find groups also we might find another pair that suits us.</p>

          <p>After walking around for an hour or so we came across a couple looking to add two more members to their team. Volker & Raina a couple from Alden who met in the academy. Volker was a fire mage and Raina and water mage. "Reingard."</p>

          <p>"Hmmm yes?"</p>

          <p>"What... is your element?"</p>

          <p>"....You don't know!?"</p>

          <p>"Well I mean when I saw you duel before it didn't look like you used any element."</p>

          <p>"Oh I see. It's metal. That's maybe why you didn't notice, its not as flashy aha."</p>

          <p>"Oh so back during the duel?"</p>

          <p>"Ah, metal manaballs, I use to struggle to infuse my mana with my element so there was no huge change in color. I found it much more effctive to make a large wide shield rarther then a small ball, easier to control and useful as a tank."</p>

          <!-- Training. -->
          <h4>Training</h4>
          <p>We too the afternoon to head into the jungles in search of monsters to hunt to hone our skills and try to work togeather as a team. The first monster we came across was not a monster I would forget anytime soon. The text book describes them as centuars, with the lower body of a horse and the upper of a man, but only in appearance, the truth was always darker then it first appeared. The body on a man on top was infact the skin of a human, sometimes whole sometimes patch work from sevral different bodies, their true form lay under the mess of meat and flesh. What that was would have to wait until after the battle.</p>
          <div class="pop">Centaur<img class="popOut" src="./images/centaur.jpg" height="400px" alt="centaur"></div>
          <p>Reingard struck first with balls of mana and tanked the centuars hooves with his shield renforced in his metal mana. Shooting into action, I charged into the monster with the skill charged charge and stuck down with stike (lightning) infused into my warhammer, I had picked up a few tricks on the way. Just like that 10% of its health disappeared.</p>

          <p>Volker summoned flames over his hands and threw a great wave of fire, washing over the monster turning the fur on his rear black, the smell of burning fur singed and hung in the air. Raina washed Reingard in water infused mana and the scratches and dirt on his skin seemed to wash away healing him for over 25% of his total health.</p>

          <p>Putting on lightning cloak I dove back into the battle, the centuar had a heavy body, large hooves and a short crude spear it swang around and tried to stab with, the trick to the centuar was to keep it from being able to charge. Reingard would block it by staying in its line of sight, I would try to heard the monster into Reingard. Since Volker was doing more dammage with his fire this worked out well for us.</p>

          <p>When I saw a gap I stuck into its knee on its rear legs, the damned monster kicked me in the chest with its hoves and I went flying. I landed against the ground and slid for abit, my lightning cloak had shocked him on impact and given Reingard the chance to provoke the monster away from me. A cool liquid flowed over me and my health started to recover from the red.</p>

          <p>Soon the monster fell and our first day of traning would stop here.The monster had dropped a necklase made of teeth and an eye ball. None of us really wanted them, but we would sell them for money, centuars cannot be found outside of the academy.</p>

          <p>Reingard - "You took quite the hit."</p>

          <p>"Yeah, I don't know how you take so many hits all day long."</p>

          <p>"High defence, and metal element help alot. Keep safe though your health is low for a melee fighter."</p>

          <p>"Yeah. Should I start buying more items? I feel like I must at least be close to paying off the debt I encured."</p>

          <p>"Sounds like a plan. Ah you two where great, Volker your fire was really effective, and Rainas healing waters work better then other healers in our year, maybe better then some second years."</p>

          <p>"Ah thank you, the range of our skills is really short however, and our vitality is not much different from squisshy Otto's here."</p>

          <p>"What a nick name..."</p>

          <p>"Well lets go celebrate with what we can buy from these, and tomorrow hunt again until we are well cordinated."</p>

          <p>"Cheers!"</p>
          <!-- level 14? attack +5 -->
          <!-- <p>Days leaning up</p> -->
          <p>The next few days went by quickly, each morning Reingard would say good bye to Tisiel, I would stand around as a third wheel, we would meet up with Volker & Raina and head into the jungle of the academy, never ventureing too far in.</p>

          <p>Quickly reviewing my stats so far I saw that I had no defences, very little health and was still reliant on a melee weapon. On the other hand I had high mana, high magic output, prehapps there was someway I could turn this into a defence. </p>

          <p>There is no way I can keep melee attacks from myself currently, but prehaps I could dodge them? Most will be mages and unable to make any meaningful damage with melee attacks during the arena.</p>

          <p>I can use the shoes Tisiel gave me more to dodge attacks then to help me move in quickly maybe to strike then use them to get away, but they only work after i've been stuck.</p>

          <h4>pov Tisiel</h4>
          <p>Sitting and minding his own thoughts Otto looked like he was lost in his own world again, but I had important infomation to share. "Otto wake up, I've made some headway on the strange syombols."</p>

          <p>"I wasen't asleep, but that is good news what did you find out?"</p>

          <p>"Right well, it's my belief that it was written by an older civisation"</p>

          <p>"Not a previous student? I guess that's something, well done."</p>

          <p>"Don't patrnoise me, I mean we all know we did not build the academy, that is known all over. I mean a civisation that use to be here but not appart of the orignal academy exsactly."</p>

          <p>"Come again?"</p>

          <p>"So some civisation built the academy, the portal and the writing system found around the academy we often call runes. However these syombles don't match, not even a little! They are from a later civisation that built ontop of the academy, they built the town near by, the smaller academy, this door inside the cliffs, the cliffs as rooms!"</p>

          <p>"It's an intresting theory but what was your break though?"</p>

          <p>"The book you gave me, it's not from the academy, you found it in a market on our continent. But look at the book, it's not magical, it's not old or rotten at all. How old could it be?"</p>

          <p>"But no one uses syombol's even like this, maybe a student sold the book to the merchant, maybe its been in here the whole time."</p>

          <p>"Yes, but you found the coins on a dead body on our continent in strange clothes? The syombols on the coins are also strange, but also found thoughout this book! And for the biggest reveal..."</p>

          <p>"This! There is a map inside the book of an unknown land, that shows on the next page.. A map of the academy. Which was very helpful as you can see there is an area to the left of the main academy building past the nobel area and into the jungle on that side."</p>

          <p>"Hmmm, adventure time? I have a few days more then enough time to make the trip, but it is quite deep into the jungle."</p>

          <p>"Yes well this time we won't be going alone, call it training for your arena team and we will take Shrorlei with us also, she is very strong."</p>

          <p>"Well lets meet up and head off in an hour, we were going to head into the jungle anyway today."</p>

          <p>"Let's!"</p>

          <h4>Jungle Run</h4>
          <p>The group took me though the jungle, deeper in it became hard to find the key locations on the map, the monsters here are often weaker then the other area's this is maybe why the nobles set up there houses around this area. The jungle became thick quickly on this side, the nobles who often left the work of maintaining the woodland to their peasants on our home continent had all but abandoned the idea of doing themselves here. The next landmark we were looking for on the map was a large rock, descriptive I Know, but as far as I can translate these syombles mean large rock and there is a picture of a rock that looks like the upturned claw.</p>

          <p>"You said a large rock."</p>

          <p>"Yes, well, it is somewhat big compared to other rocks."</p>

          <p>"The other landmarks where at least 3 times the height of a man, this is. Well it's not small but it's no taller then me, how were we suppose to find this in the jungle? The damn trees are taller, this cannot be it."</p>

          <p>"Trees? Yes, there are trees." The group looked to me as if I was the one who had gone mad. "No look at the map! There are no trees, no menction of trees. If this rock where in a grassy field you would call it a big rock. But this map is drawn without trees....Why no trees?"</p>

          <p>The group made their way the rock pointed, we followed it for a few hours before stopping for lunch. I could not take my mind off the trees. There were no trees. The map maker could not of missed them, even if he overlooked the trees becasue they where everywhere it would be wrong to call that rock big.</p>

          <p>Reingard "Still thinking about the rock? You have that face again like there is something to solve."</p>

          <p>"I just, but the rock IS smaller then the trees and no trees are menctioned. It would be weird to note the rock if there were the trees."</p>

          <p>Reingard - "Prehaps the book is older then you thought?"</p>

          <p>Biteing down on my lip "I suppose it could be but it dosen't make sense the book cannot be more then 100 years old. Yet it has a map of the academy with no trees, and was found on the main land. Too many mystories."</p>

          <p>Reingard "Relax abit, we will find more answers when we arrive."</p>

          <p>Nodding, "yeah, you are right. As usual." I smiled at Reingard. It felt awkuard to be around the others, I could not be myself with him like this. This time we would be looking for the landmark we came here for, it looked in the drawings stacks of squares stacked ontop of each other becoming smaller to the top. Not unlike the pyramids found in Pocotcotcan literature.</p>

          <div class="pop">Landmark<img class="popOut" src="./images/inca2.png" height="400px" alt="Pyramid"></div>

          <p>It took half of the afternoon for us to find a small stream which took us to the pyramid, in amoung the trees and vines was a structure of squares slowly becoming smaller until ontop stood the entrance way in the shape of a large stone square. Vegitation had grown all over the pyramid which had fallen hidden and unsued in the jungle which had grown around it, I felt as this was more evidence to my theory but maybe I am just projecting my theory onto reality.</p>

          <p>"Expore or make camp? If we head back now we won't arive back until late in the night, if we explore we might risk going without making camp." Reingard said.</p>

          <p>Shrorlei  - "We could make camp inside the entrance way, we could still retreat if we need to and it would shelter us a little more."</p>

          <p>Raina - "That sounds good, we brought food and water but not any camping equipment it would be good to save energy and mana on not having to build extensive shelter."</p>

          <p>The group was in agreement and we set up the stairs. It was not long before the complaints rolled in.</p>

          <p>Volker - "Carry me."</p>

          <p>Raina - "No. Carry me."</p>

          <p>Volker - "There are so many stairs!"</p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "The moss makes each step like standing on a pile of worms."</p>

          <p>Reingard - "Can't we take a break, we have awhile until night fall."</p>

          <p>Otto - "47...48....49"</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Do you HAVE to count!?"</p>

          <p>As soon as we arrived at the top the group fell down all around the top of the stairs, I stood and stared into the dark entance, it was a large room inside, there where no lights so I threw out a manaball inside and found that there was only one thing inside the room. A large decagon table like structure inside, made of stone that sloped from the edges into the middle. On each section was a syombol, matching thoes from before, in the center was a small fist sized hole.</p>

          <p>While the others rested I took out my notes and copied down the syombol's and tried to match them to ones I already knew. There was four unknowns, Bone Staff, Skull Staff, two unknowns, Wing and another unknown. I started to look though the book for similar markings.</p>

          <h4>Volker</h4>
          <p>Seeing Tisiel distracted as soon as we arive I light a manaball and walked around the temple, the walls where carved with scenes of everyday life, farmers, gold smiths, weapon makers & warriors. The scenes flowed one into another where on the back wall was a picture of the temple and a priest holding up an object on display for the masses blow. It suddenly felt as if cold wet eyes where looking at the back of my head.</p>

          <p>I infused fire into my mana ball, the others stared at me but I was more conserened about the wet eyes that watched my actions. I breathed in. Turning suddenly and looking in the direction of the feeling, on the roof I saw another carving looking down on us.</p>

          <p>Something about the carving felt wet. It was a mess of writing of tendrils flopping and falling over each other with a pair of black eyes in the middle. They appeared to be stareing at me.</p>

          <p>Raina - "What is it? That carving is a bit creepy."</p>

          <p>"Not sure, I felt like it was watching me."</p>

          <p>Reingard - "Sure is creepy. What is it Tisiel?"</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Dunno yet. Their god? Not sure."</p>

          <p>We made camp inside the room, and waited for the sun to rise the next morning. We ate the rations we brought along with us non of us wanted to go hunting in the jungle this deep at night. I kept the group warm by burning the wood we had taken from the base of the temple. I could not sleep, not with that thing watching us.</p>

          <h4>Pov Otto</h4>
          <p>Volker could not stop glancing at the marking on the roof, after awhile Volker took off into the jungle while the others slept and I was on watch. Maybe I should of stopped him.</p>

          <p>I turned back to looking though Tisiel's notes, the same marking kept coming over over and over. It's one I saw in the other places also, first the graveyard, then the door in the cliff side and now here.</p>

          <p>"Hey Tisiel, did you find out the purpose of that room?"</p>

          <p>"In the cliffside? Yeah it was a tomb which was in keeping with the mausoleum from the grave yard, they seem to take great intrest in death and taking their belongings with them to the grave."</p>

          <p>"Think this place is related to death?"</p>

          <p>"Yeah, but on the flip side I am hoping to get more items for necomancy. Did you wake me up just to ask that?"</p>

          <p>"You weren't asleep. Did you see Volker leave?"</p>

          <p>"What? No, where did he go?"</p>

          <p>"Into the jungle."</p>

          <p>"Should we go after him?"</p>

          <p>"No, I think the carving was creeping him out so he will just be outside."</p>

          <p>"Okay."</p>
<!-- need skull talking to necro girl  -->
          <p>I could not help but think, all of the places we found these syombols where related to death, each was a place someone had been laid to rest with their belongings but not in the same fasion, the first was a mausoleum similar to Heilerbach's method for buying their dead rulers. The second a sealed door in a cliff side, contained a spirit trapped into a skull, and now a Pocotcotcan style pyramid.</p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "Hey Otto, Tisiel."</p>

          <p>"Oh hey you okay?"</p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "Yeah just, a door in the cliff side with a person burried with all his belongings is not the best description, that door inside the cliffside is at the back of the housing area, its deep within a tunnel really."</p>

          <p>"Yeah you're not wrong.."</p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "Not being picky as such just, you might be intrested to know thats how the dwarfs burry their dead. Deep in tunnels behind doors or large rocks with the things they wanted to take with them."</p>

          <p>Otto - "The Dwarfs? You don't think these are just the resting places of the people from our continent do you? One for each style, maybe just from a previous settlement of the acadamey that is forgotten about?"</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "No, that has holes, the strange syombols that don't match any wirting system of our own, the strange coins, the places do have similarities granted but non of them are the same, the person burried in the cliffside was no dwarf, the king burried in the graveyard with necomantic items? Heilerbach's dominent religion holds the pratice as evil."</p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "So do the dwarfs."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah, this does not line up with the mainland, but yet has similarities."</p>

          <p>Otto - "Tisiel, whats this syombol mean it comes up all over the place."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Err, yeah that one is from the previous. Hold on. Monster? I thought it was monster but it makes no sense for them to be worshiping monsters, even necromancers don't worship monsters they use their bodies."</p>

          <p>Volker - "Demons." Volker's voice boomed though the room and bounced of the walls, he strode up to the table and slamed down a dead doe. The blood splattered across the table from it's wounds. Volker drew a knife and cut the animals thoat and the blood ran down the table to the hole and fell inside.</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "What are you doing!? Now we can't read it. Where did you get that?"</p>

          <p>Otto - "Demons?"</p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "Is that your offering to them?"</p>

          <p>Volker nodded. "Demons always want a blood sacrfice, that thing on the roof.." His words stopped short of explaining himself as the temple began to shake. Gently at first before a large violent trust, managing to keep balance everyone was up if Volker had not woke them before and the shaking suddenly stopped. To the right of the table where it had been floor before had slid open to reveal a passageway down into the darkness.</p>

          <p>Shrorlei threw a mana ball down the passageway the stairs spiraled down. I took a peek down and inside although it was hard to see where stone statue's all over. Stone warriors, Stone monsters, Stone wizards even a stone priest. Lastly there was a large stone king sitting on a stone throne. I looked to Tisiel. "A secound king."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Prehaps a third? We know to little of the cliffside tomb, but I won't rule it out."</p>

          <p>Reingard & Volker & Shrorlei made their way down the stairs, followed by Raina and Tisiel. I waited looking at the doe laying dead on the table, its blood still dripping down into the hole in the middle. I looked up to see the monster carved into the roof, it did look as if it was staring at the doe which lay on the table. "Enjoy the meal."</p>

          <p>I followed after the others down into the depts of the pyramid. The others where twisting and diving their way though the statues towards the king, I decided to head over to the priest to see what kind of clues about their religion I could find out about.</p>

          <p>The priest had a ankel length robe with many colors and patters all over, some of birds and trees, not skulls or anything of death however. He held a large pole arm with an axe head and a spear head combined, it was a weapon pocotcotco warroirs have been recorded using.</p>

          <h4>POV Tisiel</h4>
          <p>Down stairs were row after row of colorful statues of warriors and mages monsters and aniamals alike, there where a few larger then others and some so small you could keep them on your desk as a toy. The king was seated on a large throne with a crown atop his head.</p>

          <p>We made a B line to the king, dodging and weaving between the stone people. The king was as colorful as his subjects with a crown of gold and many gems embedded inside. The statue's where all painted and although clearly made of stone the work was so well done as to be life like unlike the carvings which adorned the pyramid its self outside.</p>

          <p>The kinds hands were wrapped around the chair he sat on, at his feet where offerings of food, wine, gold and weapons. Unfortunatly they where just stone recreations. The only other things of note where his bodyguards and a stone tablet with the strange syombols written across them. This time however I could see the numbers which I found on some of the coins Otto had given me at the start. This was a list, of ... something.</p>

          <p>Reingard had come to stand by me, I grabbed at the hem of his trousers. He just replied with a smile. Volker and Raina had taken intrest in the king for awhile before looking around and marveling at the creatures some of which I had not even seen in books yet. Shrorlei had followed us at first but now she was to be found with a manaball in hand looking at the art on the walls. It seemed like at last me and Reingard had some time alone.</p>

          <p>"You have not forgot why we came here?"</p>

          <p>"No I haven't but where to start? There is nothing of value here. I mean nothing of value we can exchange easily, I am sure the place it's self is worth a small fortune to somebody."</p>

          <p>"Hmm the boxes at the kings feet, it's in the book 10 for the demons of death and one for the lord. They might be stone but the insides should be what we came for."</p>

          <p>"Right." Reingard moved to open the stone chests quickly and quietly as the others marveled at the at the the wonders on display.</p>

          <p>Reingard stuff what he found into the bag at his waist and slide it under his cloak. As soon as he had Tisiel had finished making a sketch of the stone tablet they felt the pyramid shake again. A slow gentle rumble, building in intensity.</p>

          <p>"Time to go" I shouted, grabbing my parchments and Reingard's hard we ran dodging ducking diving back though the stone warriors and to the stairs. Volker and Raina had clearly heard me and we made to to the stairs togeather, Otto and Shrorlei were no where to be seen. I tugged on Reingard's hand and we climbed the stairs looking out to try and spot them, Shrorlei could not be seen, she was not a tall girl she could be behind any of these statue's. Otto was not hiding himself at all, he stood atop a 10m tall statue of a stag. I shouted to him to come quickly, but he just did not move.</p>

          <p>We waited in the room above for the other two worried the entanceway to the stairs would close any moment, when we had arrived on top the most obvious change was the doe that Volker had left on the stone table was gone. Not a trace was left not a single drop of blood. Suddenly the shaking stop. SLAM. I jumped the entrance way had shut tight.</p>

          <p>Volker - "I guess we should get another to open it up for them again.."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah, let's hunt one quickly I don't think staying inside there will be good." We made out way into the jungle togeather to hunt.</p>

          <h4>POV Shrorlei</h4>
          <p>I had spent my time going though the art-work on the walls when I felt the pyramid shake again, before I could make to to the stair case I saw the others move up and the lid shut. I did no panic I had food, water and they would open the lid again, if not though a new hunt then getting help from the acadamey. Okay maybe I was a little panicked.</p>
          
          <p>The art work had been beautiful but haunting. It had shown a war, a great war but not over land, food, water, precious gems but people. They had gone to war against other races for their people. To be precise the dwarves, elfs, gnolls, gonomes and many I had never seen before. They took them to this temple, placed them on the tables and removed their hearts. It was hard to say why, or what they did with the hearts that was so important to them, the drawings just go into the creature of the stone statues around us now.</p>

          <p>I walked towards the stairs, I should wait there. On my way back I felt a sudden and blow to the back of my head, it felt as if my brain way trying to jump though the front of my skull as I fell face first into the grond, my nose bent on impact the blood splattered accros the floor. I felt too much of a shock to move much at all the pain soon surged though me and I became overwheled. Reaching for my knife.</p>

          <h4>POV - Otto</h4>
          <p>The group of Reingard, Tisiel, Volker, Raina had come back holding with them some dead rabbits, sitting in the with the things they had left behind I smiled down at them, waiting for them to climb the stairs so we could pack and head home.</p>

          <p>"How, *pant* are you *pant* on the outside?"</p>
          <p>"It opens from the inside."</p>
          <p>"And you did not think to let Shrorlei out with you?"</p>
          <p>"Shrorlei? I thought she left first?" - Otto</p>
          <p>"We thought she was trapped in there with you." - Tisiel</p>
          <p>"Let's just open it back up" - Volker</p>

          <p>They had cut the rabbits ontop of the table like before and spilt blood onto the table. While the others spent their time looking for Shrorlei I had opted to stay outside just incase with Tisiel. I told her I had found another coin around the priest and guardian sitting on a stone alter between them. Showing her the coin. It was similar to the coin in the last womans grave in weight & size. On her coin was a king with a skull for a face and the other a strange syombol like the syombols on the table upstairs. This new coin had the same syombol on one side and priest on the other holding a heart above a pyramid just like this one.</p>

          <p>Soon the others came up while Tisiel was checking out the new coin, she placed it back in my hand as the others come up with ugly faces. "What is wrong?" Tisiel asked quielty beside me.</p>

          <p>"Shrorlei is dead. Found her with her head beaten in and mostly crushed, a large hold in her chest. As soon as we found her we left, we should tell the acadamey." - Volker</p>

          <p>Otto - "I know we are in shock, but we should move quickly. What ever killed her might still be in there or of been let free, there is nothing else we can do from here."</p>

          <p>And like that we headed back for the acadamey, silence filled the hike home.</p>

          <h4>Tisiel, Reingard</h4>
          <p>Sitting togeather Reingard and Tisiel in Tisiel's room they looked over the items they got from the pyramid. 10 items in total, one matching each of the syombols on the table above. Tisiel took a staff with a skull afixed to the top which aided in the creation of skeletons. The other items would bring them in more money then they could earn working though the acadamey or even as mercanies for a few years. These items where unique and that made them one of a kind, even if they were not the best combat pieces they would still be sort after.</p>

          <p>I found myself sitting back in my room holding two coins, all of this was getting abit weird. Although we had not found a coin in the cliffside it was surely a burial place as Shrorlei had said, does not mean there was not a coin down there just I did not find it. This time Shrorlei had lost her life. For a single coin the cost was too high, but for what was learned maybe the price had to be paid.</p>

          <p>I decided to head down to Tisiel and Reingard and see what they had learned during this visit. As expected when I knocked they made me wait, sounded like they where clearing up in there but seeing them run around and pick up their clothes was not something I wanted to see. Stepping inside they stood awkuardly. "Sorry if you two where getting it on, I only came to ask about what you had translated so far."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "No no we were ... just come in it's fine, I have so much new information to look though, it's a shame the acadamey will be taking over the site and I won't be able to gather anymore first hand information but come take a look." She gestered me to come and sit as Reingard sat down next to her desk also. Across it was layed various books, items and coins.</p>

          <p>"The various names printed on the table were things they gave offerings to, of blood. We believe animals and possibly humans or other races but we are unsure for now. The main point is there where 10 of them and they are kind of demons, I call them this because the blood and the references to them being down under so I think this is the best translation for now." - Tisiel</p>

          <p>"What about the creature drawn above the table?"</p>

          <p>"Not one of them, although it had kind of eyes to us, it is possible we are just projecting onto it and it might of been a drawing of something else so I am not sure what that was of."</p>

          <p></p>

          <p>"Well onto the more intresting stuff. The people which made up these socities where obssessed with death, gods of death, demons of death and the pratice of necomancy which is perfect for me that they died out and the pratice is not as widly used because what was theirs is now mine."</p>

          <p>"As long as I get stronger I don't mind joining these expadidtions. Although I cannot say I have a need or intrest in necomancy. I am sure you will become one of the legends said to raise whole armies from the dead."</p>

          <p>"Aha, I am happy with just a few cute skeleton helpers here and there. I don't plan on becoming a combat mage anyway. You might be more intrested to know that the coins while they are magic items according to this..." Tisiel flipped though her note book and the book from the market to show me her notes. "They are a type of single use item."</p>

          <p>"So I can use them but only once? How do I use the coins? What do they do?"</p>

          <p>"Ah, you place them on your eyes, what to do is vague at best, something about their gods maybe demons? I would say beings worthy or pray?"</p>

          <p>"So I am just going to have to try them to find out? Seems like a waste, it might be better to sell them."</p>

          <p>"Yeah, I was thinking the same. I am sorry Otto I thought they would be more useful since they were found in impotant sites I really dont understand."</p>

          <p>"Well I'll keep hold of them maybe we can shead more light on them in the future, it's not like I can sell them for the right price by saying I have no idea what they do, and when you use them they will be gone forever."</p>

          <p>"Yeah...Sorry..."</p>

          <p>"No worries, I am going to head back out and leave you two to .. studying."</p>

          <p>"Later!" - Reingard</p>
          <p>"Come round anytime!" - Tisiel</p>

          <p>I left them and headed up topside to the traning ground for the cliffside, overlooking the academy it was a nice place to come to, but today I did have something to pratice. I had not told Tisiel everything that had happend down in that pyramid or everything I knew of the coins.</p>

          <p>I got down on the floor and started to pray. I was never a relgious man but I had found faith down in that pyramid. Praying was common in Alden, for thoes that had faith they could be granted spells or skills by the ones they pray to. I soon got a reply.</p>

          <!-- Title Here -->

          <p>"Hunt the stag."</p>

          <p>A blinding pain filled my brain as images and information followed though. It was not just any stag that would do, an elemental creature the thunder stag. Most elemental creatures are rare, hard to find and tricky to handle. I imagine such a creature is far stronger then myself. I had got my first quest and I knew what I had to do, that was a start.</p>

          <p>To help me along I had been granted 1 faith. I could use this to cast a spell of the deities choice and recharge it daily though prayer. I opened the menu to see what spell I had been granted, it was unlikly the spell could be changed.</p>

          <p>"Kʼawiil's lightning seeds. Plant the seeds of lighting on a target and lightning skills will be amplified."</p>

          <p>Ekʼ Chuah was not a lightning god, lightning demon or anything of the sort. Where in the hell did Ekʼ Chuah get a lightning power from and who was Kʼawiil? Too many questions, questions I feel I won't be getting the answers to.</p>

          <!-- <p>God L grans the Power of god K though faith.</p> -->

          <!-- Gods of worship require pray for awhile to grant faith based classes and then faith spells, gods of no worship have their attention on one or few indivduals and are able to grand faith spells before to increase their following. Often gods fall out of fashion due to relgious wars and differences or socicaltal pressure. And you can get faith spells from the new god, maybe there spells suit you better or your socoity finds more acceptable the requirments such as the hunt or sacrificce will be popular before are not popular now. -->

          <p>I went on the trip to become stronger, I had become stronger but not in the way I had hopped I had no more defences then when I left the arena rounds would start tomorrow the best I could do now was pratice with my new skill get some rest and hope for good match ups.</p>

          <p>I set off and headed to the arena, I met up with Reingard, Volker and Raina there. We would head into the armory below the arena, most students by now had their own weapons or had a set weapon they would use it was very rare for a student to change their weapon this far into the year. I would not be changing mine from my warhammer anytime soon.</p>

          <p>Raina had a two handed staff with patterns of water craved thoughout, Volker carried a wand with a small shield. Reingard however had come with a large metal chain around his neck and a large metal shield in his hand.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Reingard."</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Otto."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Don't play dumb, what is that?"</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Ah, I got this yestoday. I had managed to exchange some things for them. This is a metal kite shield imbu.."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Not the shield."</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Didn't even let me finish. Fine, its a magic chain weapon I exchanged for something important I had. I just could not resist it matches my element so well. Take a look."</p>

          <li>Primary:<font color="blue">Kusari-fundo (half)</font> +3 Dexterity, can be extended or move with mana.</li>

          <p>Otto - "How the hell do you plan to use this thing while holding a shield?"</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Ah well it's only a half length so this is a handle, and the other end is weighted not both, think of it like a metal whip, because of my element I can exert some level of control over it."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Alright.. Just don't hit me in the back of the head with it."</p>
          <p>Reingard - "I promise not to hit you in the back of the head."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Or the front"</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Ot the front."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Just, don't hit me anywhere with it! Your words make me uneasy!"</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Aha, I will not hit you with it."</p>

          <p>It was not long before the four of us found ourselves waiting at the foot of the entrance way to the arena, I had walked it before but that was when the arena was split and both combatants would enter though the same gate, it felt different this time. We walked the long curved tunnel up to the arena entrance the light at the end of the tunnel spread around the mouth of the exit. Blinded, our eyes soon adjusted and before us was a metal gate holding us back from entering the arena, the opposite team already waiting behind theres.</p>

          <p>Arena Guard -- "You can move around in your half of the arena before the match stats, position how you like, set traps and cast spells but if you make a move, spell or anything else to the other half of the arena or combatants before the match stats you will be disqualified. Good luck."</p>

          <p>There was a metalic screech and rumble as the bars fell into the earth, small holes left behind and we steped out into the arena. We had 20 seconds to get ourselfs into position and be ready to fight. The floor of the arena had a thin coating of sand not enough to effect walking but enough to soak up the blood I guess.</p>

          <p>The opposing team was also a group of four, more traditional mage group with staffs, wands and a dai-furyo (hand fan). Reingard was stood infront of me a little to my left and Volker infront of Raina to our left. The match started with the sounding of a large bell, I opened with a wall of lightning wall infront of Volker's opponents, turning my attention to Reingard who had thrown his chain while keeping his shield up trying to stike a mage with a wand in the back, when they moved Reingard adjusted the path with his mana and stuck him in the stomach, the mage keeled over but was not out.</p>

          <p>The mage infront of us with a staff slamed it to the ground in responce broken earth and soil where flug at Reingard's eyes. I put on my lightning cloak spell and Charged Charge into the staff wielding mage. I swung my warhammer high and he moved his staff high coliding togeather in a test of strength he lost baddly (-17% health). Testing out my new faith spell I threw my left hand open and the seeds materalised and landed on him, clinging to him like barbed plants.</p>

          <p>In return the wand mage stuck me with a lighting manaball, the earth mage followed up with an infused manaball of his own but I activated my boots and bounced behind Reingard who tanked the blast with his shield. As we moved forward my hand on his sholder his shield up, I took the time to see how Volker and Raina where holding up. The arena near them had the air filled with flames and the ground covred in water, as the fan mage blew back the flames with his wind magic the other wand mage blew across the tip of his wand as a black cloud of smoke bellowed from the end and glided across the arena.</p>

          <p>As we moved in range of these two mages Reingard charged into the lightning mage, I bounced out from behind him and struck the earth mage with chainlightning. The seeds activated doing their job, a full 28% of his health disappeared and the bolt flew off to meet his friend. The earth mage was hanging just above 50% hp at this point, I was sure I could take him alone but was not confident I would leave the fight with the ability to help the others. I dashed back to see Reingard managing to hold off the lighting mage with ease but unable to inflict any serious dammage, he would be okay if I left him with both mages for awhile out left flank is falling back.</p>

          <p>The wand mages poison gasses had been burned up by Volker where he could but they where not looking the healthest right now. The air mage used his large fan to move the poison clouds about and beat back the fire Volker had sent their way. Raina's water magic was great for healing but could not inflict any damage on her oppoennt's and like this they had been gaining the upper hand.</p>

          <p>I bolted my way across the arena and activated charged charge, at almost 300 mana to start with I had dropped to about 80% remaining. The wind mage blow a gust my way but I did not stop, and colided with the poison mage, the lighting cloak flew off me and ran into him like a bolt as my warhammer met the side of his head. His body disappeared from the arena, the judges must of thought this a leathal blow. One down.</p>

          <p>The wind mage backed up by puhsing the wind infrount of him and using it to glide backwards 1 meter, he was out of my range at over 1 meter since I could not charge with magic again so soon. "Help Reingard" I shouted to the others, I heared them run off away from me as I tried to cornor the wind mage.</p>

          <p>I ran stright for him trying to finish him off also when I was hit with a wind infused mana-ball, the blow had come so quick I did not register it at first (-43%). I could not allow him to keep that up, I stuck with lightning strike (-57%), he had high magic defences it seems. I sprinted into him with my warhammer striking his chest, his body soon disappeared from the arena as I felt a huge pressure above me push me down and a sucking woosh, next thing I saw was the arena underground where I had come in, standing next to an small water fountin at the base of the entrance tunnel to the area. I must of reached my last 10 hp, guess he still had enough mp left to use strike also.</p>

          <!-- mana drain is power of spell * 10?  -->

          <p>Soon enough my team mates came back down the tunnel, walking, they had won the rest of the match with Raina's healing waters they were able to grind though the rest of their health.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Welcome back!"</p>
          <p>Reingard - "Prehaps next time you could join us in walking back down."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I'll work on it."</p>

          <p>The was the end of our first match, we would not have to participate again until the next drawings in a week, with that in mind I took some time to watch some of the other matches.</p>

            <p>"You came to watch a fight, and a fight you shall have! It's a second year student team showdown in a battle to determin the victor! Lower the gates!"</p>
            <p>The green team is made up of all fire-mages, prehaps they should of been the red team! The red team is a mixed group of water, ice, wind and light! This should be quite the showdown!</p>
            <p>A heated start, the green team had throw fireballs, waves of flames and whisps all across the field! Red team rebutted with waterballs, ice walls, and a large gust of wind subdueing the raging flames! A light has filled the arena shining in the eyes of the green team! What a start!</p>
            <p>Green team are putting on the pressure again, fireballs and flamethrowers tryign to group up the red team, the ice spears and water walls only doing so much to hold them back, light magic while powerful in areas is really strugging to hold back the flames it might be we have our first out.</p>
            <p>What is this! Green team's team captin is summoning a fire elemental! This could be a game changer! Red team where already launching a plan of their own! Red teams wind mage has launched herself into the air!</p>
            <p>Now she is airbone her wind infused manaballs are raining down  on the summoning mage with no defence to be found! This explains the green teams aggressive start they where doing it to protect their captin!</p>

          <h4>Fair Date</h4>
                    <!-- Gives Tsuma the witches hat -->
          <p>Tsuma - "I have always wanted to be a witch, the kind of a boomstick, big witch hat, and a black cat."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Just like the fairy tales, you would make a beautiful witch zooming though the sky on your boomstick."</p>
          <p>Tsuma - "Aww, yeah something like that." She said softly and looked away abit embrassed by the compliments.</p>
          <p>Otto - "Oh, I got you a gift." I took out the witches hat from my bag and handed it to her. "It's for you, it's a witches hat and a magic item so you can wear it whenever you like."</p>
          <p>Tsuma - "Really? Really? It's for me? I can keep it? It's really expensive, you should use it for yourself."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I would not make a great witch, I mean I use a warhammer for a start, it looks better on you, and I have another head piece so I really don't need it, it's yours now, it's a gift."</p>
          <p>Tsuma - "Thank you." She replied with the cutest face, head down and holding onto the hat with two hands.</p>
          <p>Otto - "Put it on let's see."</p>
          <p>The hat fit her perfectly, it was a magical item after all and would always fit perfectly.</p>

          <h4>tomb raid</h4>
          <!-- Have item the mask, wand to detect magic, bouncy shoes. Titles & race! -->
          <p>No sooner had I made it back inside of the cliff side I was ambushed by Tisiel and Reingard. The excitment on their faces left me feeling excited too I could not help but give a smile from ear to ear. Am I getting addicted to plundering the resting places of the dead? Something like this should horrify me.. What would my family think. Shaking of the cob-web like feeling of the ethics behind it I had to ask what they had found out this time.</p>

          <p>Tisiel had told me she had found the location of another tomb, unlike the last times this tomb was not near the academy, or even above ground. While the cliff side study was underground the entrnace was very visible if it had not been for the restrictions placed on the door and the gernal acceptence that the cliff side was nothing worth thinking about another mage would of surely broken in before us.</p>

          <p>The tomb was located over 300km away from the academy, this would not be a short sally out into the forest but a long expadidtion. We would need to sign out of the academy to do something like this, if we just up and leave without saying anything the academy might follow us and if they discover the tomb for themselves they might take all of the treasure as they have with the pyramid even banning us from going by saying it was dangerous. Well, Shrorlei had died but there was always danger involved when taking from the dead.</p>

          <p>Reingard put foward a plan, one I was not to keen on but if it worked then we might just get back without pulling too much attention to ourselves. After all once might of been luck, but if we discover an old tomb twice, people would start asking questions.</p>
          <!-- Tisiel" Reingard".  -->

          <p>In the morning the next day we made our way into the academy, Reingard went off to get food and other miscellaneous supplies. I made my way into one of the cafe's with Tisiel, we took a table with 4 chairs and spread out a map across the table.</p>

          <!-- unique race, lighting resistance, lightning trap -->

          <p>We had not been there more then 1 hour before we were approached by a group of older students in the 3rd year, they made to block any exit routes before asking about our maps, where we were going, what had we found. This kind of treatment was obviously taboo and they would never behave like this with other students. However we were not normal students, we where students in the first year, from the cliffs, there was no way we had any backing.</p>

          <p>There was 5 of them in total, the first to approach us and speak had a sly smile across his face, hair pushed back as if he had just run both his greasy hands though his hair. Since they where in the 3rd year they must be doing their work experience here in the academy. At least we could be sure they were not direct combat mages. The only reason a mage might stay is to study theory under one of the professors.</p>

          <p>"Look, we know you are the ones who came across that pyramid. You should of had us with you then you might of made it back with some of thoes treasures before the academy could lay claim to all of them. Tell you what if one of you dies again on this trip we promise not to tell the academy, and if you don't die we will even help you keep one treasure. How generous is that? Thats 100% more treasure then you kept last time. What do you say?"</p>

          <p>I had to hand it to him, he would be great at selling water to fish. The words clearly stated he did not care if we lived or died as long as he got his hands on some treasure and made it sound like it was a great deal for us. I gave a small passing smile to Tisiel, it seems we would have no choice but to bring them with us if we didn't want the academy finding out.</p>

          <p>Before we had a chance to reply, his hand slamed down in the middle of the table bringing the attention of everyone in the cafe.</p>

          <p>"What's it gonna be!?" As he looked between us my eyes flitted over to Tisiel, he quickly picked up on this. Tisiel would be hard pressed to forgive me for that mistake. Staring at Tisiel he spoke slowly. "So you are the brains are you? Figures, this guys has too much muscle to be a real mage".</p>

          <p>As thoes words left his mouth I could not help but wonder how skinny he was under that robe. I was by no means a mountin of muscles, even Reingard was larger then I was. However everyone here knew muscles would not help in a fight between mages as most mages do not put any stat points into strength so their muscles would just be for show.</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Looks like we have no choice but to welcome you on our trip..."</p>

          <p>"Hey don't say it so defeated, this is a good thing for you. We are your seniors after all, you are more likely to come out alive with us around, you might learn something and if you are really lucky maybe you will catch one of our eyes.." The last line came out with a creepy drawl.</p>

          <p>All we could do was sit there as they joined us at the table and we told them when and where we were going and what we had found at the pyramid, we might of embleshed a little when it came to the amount treasure found and lied a little about where the treasure was now, namely in the hands of some of the professors at the academy. Thankfully they believed us thinking that we were so inferior it never crossed their minds that we would lie to them, or maybe it just lined up with that they thought was already true. Either way, to be sure, I had no doubts that we would go "missing" during this trip of ours, and after our rooms would be turned over.</p>

          Noticed by a God - get the notice of a God, (varies) -->

          <p>Our discussion continued for another few hours, we agreed that they would pick us up and take us to the location of the tomb. We would provide them with our understanding of the prevrious tombs, and act as guides, no doubt this meant guinea pigs for the various traps there could be found thoughtout such old tombs. In return they would offer us protection, both from the various monsters and the academy by providing them academy with the explanation that we were occupying them as field hands for their studies. This would acctually lift the suspicions of the acadmey members as such group outings where not uncommon as a benfit to both parties and would likely never venture anywhere too dangerous or be able to find anything that would intrest or value for the academy to step in.</p>

          <p>One month later they arrived outside of the cliffs early in the morning. The 5 from the cafe and one more who we did not know or agree upon. Tisiel & Reingard where up waiting in the living area down stairs before I had made it down, since the 3rd years where unwilling or unable to get into the cliff side we had a small window of time to double check our side of the plan. After all there was no way we were really going to agree to what they have suggested in the cafe.</p>

          <p>With fake smiles placed on our faces, inventoy full of supplies and academy robes on our backs we left to meet with the group waiting outside. The awkuard greetings over they quickly informed us the new guy was given premission to go into the field for his studies and could take others with him as help. This way they could pass though without raising any suspicions during a time when the academy was clamping down on student exploration outside of the academy grounds.</p>

          <p>The target was a cave entrance far to the north of the academy, Tisiel claimed </p>

          <!-- Placeholder -->
          <h4>Shrine Date</h4>
          <!-- Mask -->
          <p>I took out the mask I had gotten from Leon back when I last visited him, we had no clue about what it was or used for but I figured I'd give a shot asking since it looks like a Leikan design. I held it out in two hands and asked, "Do you know what this is? I don't. It was a gift from a friend.."</p>

          <p>She looked back at the mask then laughed a little, "You must have an intresting friend to give you a gift like this, it is a shrine mask. we wear them during festivals and special days when we visit the shrines. There are two kinds, ceremonial and goddly. Once you have a god you wish to follow, you take the mask to a shine and get it blessed by the god. If the shrine is a shrine to that god that would be better, but it is not necessary. The god will bless the mask, similar to religious jewlery here in Alden."</p>

          <p>"Oh, then does this belong to someone already?"</p>

          <p>"If it did it does not now, there is no spirit mark on this mask." She held out a white and red mask, it had the face of a tiger but it was quite cute and would only cover the top half of a face. "This is my mask, if you let your mana feel the mask you can see that my mana is infused with the mask, this is a kind of mark to bind the mask to me."</p>

          <p>I passed my mana over the mask and could feel the familiar mana of Tsuma coming from inside the mask. I had to ask "would I be able to bind with this mask?"</p>

          <p>"Is that what you want? Once bound it would be very difficult to break that connection with the god."</p>

          <p>"I can have a connection to more then one God right?"</p>

          <p>She gently placed the tiger mask in her hand onto her face, no straps where needed it gently fit into place as if it was made to fit, "If other Alden's heared what you just said they would be very shocked.." She walked towards the shine and I followed mask in hand. "It is not possible to recieve the faith spells from more then one God. However.. It is possible to make a connection to more then one God and wear and recieve benifits from the items of other Gods.." With a small smile she lead me to the front of the shrine.</p>

          <!-- Byakko, autem, west metal, lightning (our book) -->
          <!-- white stag,  -->
          <p>"The stag mask you have reprents one of the gods of lightning. The white stag is from one of the local religions, Chingaling I believe. they have a similar religion to us, Alden puts Chingaling, Huonhia and Lekia's religions into the same catagory." Pointing to the white tiger mask she has on her face and says "This mask also represents a God of lightning, Byakko, he is the lord of season of autumn, the west and metal. What is import for us though is that both will be Gods of lightning!"</p>

          <p>I could not help but let out a small laugh and smile, seeing that we would be bound in this small way gave me a feeling of butterflies in the pit of my stomach. To make a connection though the mask I had to produce a drop of my blood and place it inside of the mask where the mask would touch my face, place it on the alter inside the shrine and make an ernest attempt to connect to the white stag God. If all went well the god would bless the mask and it would become a magical item, then I could fill the mask with my mana and bind it to myself.</p>

          <!-- god reply? -->

          <p>I picked up the mask and scanned it with my mana, I was told white stag mask would increase my magic by {0.4 x level} points or something equivlent, if I had a suitable lightning type power then the mask might be blessed with a lightning blessing. Either way the item would be a common item and the description name would be blue.</p>

          <li>Head:<font color="blue"> Ceremonial White Stag Mask.</font> Magic: +4.</li>

          <p>When I scanned my mask what I saw was supprising, it must have something to do with the new class I aquired because the mask was not even close to the expected.</p>

          <li>Head:<font color="purple"> Heavenly White Stag Mask.</font> Magic: +4.</li>

          <p>"You said there were two types of masks?"</p>

          <p>"Oh, yeah the second type is not a kind of mask you will be able to get, it is a heavenly mask, this kind of mask there is only one of in the world and contains the will of that God. These masks are held in the main shrine in Otsu the capital city of Leika."</p>

<!-- Normal in the world to reach level 100, but few reset becasue the chances of unlocking anything new is little and it leaves you open to attack while you level back up. The advanced classes play a large role in the old world but in the new world people are leveling up less so getting to 100 is a big deal. -->
