            <h2>0-14</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Charia Jun 12 21-12, GrandDuchy of Alden. Near the village of Steinauhau, 24km from the nearest neighbour village of Sweausern. A rebellion is being hosted in the neighbouring provance of Heilerbach. The GrandDuchy of Alden is home to 3.2 million people and about 58km. Making it the 2nd smallest state on the continent of Charia. Steinauhau is a small village with an urban population of 1700 people and rural population of 9300 people. It sits in a temperate forest near the sea, in the Northen area of the continent.</p>

            <!-- Starting with the setting up of the place? and events. -->
          <p>"Congradulations!" a unified cheer rang out around the town hall, looking down into his cup David laments, the reflection looking back at him is far older then it use to be, stiff and past the age where he should be drinking luminessant green drinks, but he had always liked melon pop from his first taste over 70 years ago now. Soon the reflection in the cup smiles back. "You look happier then you have in years" his thoughts intrupted David turns to see his old friend Edmure. "I was just thinking about how new life replaces the old" he continues to smile. With a frown and then a small smile Edmure retorts "You thinking Michkels new babe is here to replace you?, there is still life left in the both of us yet". The small gathering carries on into the night. June 12th a night the people of Alden celebrate the new life brought into this world over the past year, a small tradition as not all make it past infancy.</p>

          <h3>Play day</h3>
            <!-- starting with the kids meeting as friends, introduce the town, some news the people, small parts of the world, culture-->
          <p>"Hey Karla" Michkel waves across the village square towards a tall woman holding hands with 3 children. Two older girls and a boy, all the children had red hair like their mother. As the two groups get closer Michkel nudges Sarah his wife and points to his son's smiling face, they smile to each other. "Good to see you are all well" Sarah say's towards Karla and bends down to smile at the children. "Where is Robert?" chimes Michkel. "He's going to meet us later on, went to the hall to get the news and left me alone with these loverly lot" Karla replies. The now larger group makes their way towards a near by wood, where they meet with other adults of the village and their children, the group of children run off into the forest to play as the adults make way for a fire, today is a festive day June 12th.</p>

          <!-- Children in the forest -->
         <p>The group of 7 laughing running into the forest, beyond the eyes of their parents, they arrive at a circular clear area within the small wooded area they often play. Eugen 13 years of age, larger, and taller then the others of the group, but without a temper or ambition he plays with children younger then him rarther then the older children of the village. Beke, 12 a slow child, but easily angered. Ilse 12, the oldest child of Sarah and Robert. Effi 10 the younger sister of Ilse. Otto 10 the oldest son of Michkel and Karla, with two younger brothers, and a sister on the way. Nils 10 the 8th child of the village leader, although only 5 remain. Jakob 9, A small boy, shy and ungifted.</p>

         <!-- <p>The children are armed with wood swords, shields, spears and staves. Today like most days they pretend to be heroes from old stories, facing off in small 1v1's with little orgnisation or any teams at all. After settling their small disputes and deciding who gets to be which hero they turn to battle their foe as a team. Under the command of Ilse, who while not the oldest child was Eugen had to little ambition to even lead a group as small as this and Beke who's temper is too hot to make any meaningful decisions. They charge in and out fighting a tree with a 'monster' draw onto the side.</p> -->

         <!-- What about adding the children arguing instead of jsut saying they did? -->
        
        <p>"I want to be a fighter today!"</p>
        <p>"Do you even know what fighters do? I heared your parents where farmers"</p>
        <p>"Ofcouse I know! We all went to lessons, they move the mana inside them to where it is needed to become faster or stronger" Otto replies happy with himself </p>
        <p> "You cant be a fighter, you don't have a sword, bow or anything at all! you have to be a mage, unless you want to be a rouge.." Beke snickers.</p>
        <p> Otto picks up a stick and swings it about like a sword</p>
        <p>"ahahaha" Beke burts into laughter</p>
        <p>"It's a wand. I was just testing it."</p>
        <p>"You two stop arguing and get into posistion the monster is here!" Ilse points to a tree with a monster draw onto it's side..</p>
        <p>
        That is how the team ended up with 4 melee fighters, 2 ranged fighters and 1 mage</p>
         
         <p>"Charge!" <br> "Heavy blow!" <br>  "Battle shout!" <br> "Provoke" </p>
         <p>The sounds of the fight ring out though the small clearing. "Hig-h Impact!!", "Fire Ball!". "fire ball? That's not a junior skill thats imtermediate. We all agreed to start at junior level." Berk grows towards the smaller Otto. "I thought we must of leveled up by now!" retorts Otto. "Why would we level up it's not even dead yet!" Berk shouts back. "come on now, we can't get distracted in a fight! Otto must of just got tired of being the mage every time" Ilse steps in to redirect Berks attention. "He's the mage because he cannot afford a real weapon, that is not even a wand it's just a stick" Beke spits out. Otto looks down at the stick in his hand, true enough it was no real wand. "that's what wands are, just sticks, now kill that monster!" Isle points towards the tree and Beke runs up and slams his shield into the tree and stabs it with his sword point before triumptly shouting that he had slain the monster.</p>
         <!-- The play introduces the reader in to what happens in the world, and monsters -->

          <!-- play comes to an end, the festivities start -->
          <p>As the sun reaches the middle of the sky the group run back from the forest at the smell of food, they soon catch the lights of the large fire and the food being passed around the smaller children and the adults. They pick up the pace and run over to join in the festivities.</p>

          <!-- They continue their days with the adults working, the children play or help out -->
          <!-- news could be brought back from the town hall by Robert -->
            <p>Charia Jun 12 21-22, The GrandDuchy shares a large boarder with the Principality of Huonhia to the south-east, a small boarder with the Principality of Leikia to the South. A mostly abandoned boarder with the Kingdom of Hatalisa to the west. The kingdom has recently made peace with the Pocotocotcan Theocracy, after joining forces with Leikia, Chalbia & the Mifuegan League off far to the west, the peace led Pocotcotcan to give lands to the Empire, including the trading town of Tlapatan.</p> 
                     
            <p> To the North they share another large boarder with the Heilerbach Republic, along this boarder on the Republics side has growing unrest. Due to their neighbours attention being focused west, or internally the GrandDuchy has had relative pace thoughout the past decade.</p>
            <!-- around the year 21-22 the rebelion breaks out -->

            <h3>Incident</h3>
          <!-- the incident -- re-do, the reader leaves knowing the world is not easy, the game style world they live in, charter skeletons they take with them. -->
          <p>The group are playing deep inside the forest when one of them discovers lurking near by is a leaf green figure, with a large yellow eye, webbed hands and feet with black sharp nails attached, a small belly and a slight hunchback. Its mouth shaped like bird beak but with small teeth protruding up from below. One of them shouts "monster detected!" and all the children scramble towards the creature in a charge. Unaware of the dangers of reality.</p>

          <p>Ilse shouts commands at the others to form up, and attack, ordering Otto to cast a protection spell on the Eugen, Effi to stand and protect her as she gives commands, Jakob and Nils to use their bows and for Beke Eugen to run forth and provoke the creature.</p>

          <p>At first the young Kappa is supprised and taken back by the sundden attacks and loud shouting, the children are spured on by their advantage and Beke slams his shield into the creature and stabs at its ribs with his wooden sword shouting "shield bash" with great joy. Eugen follows up by stabbing into the creature with his spear, the tip is dull but with enough force to pierce though the creatures skin, a long high screech sounds out in the clearing, confident Eugen tries to thrust further in but is unable. A toy arrow lands at Jakob's feet, Nils off into the distance. A child's cry fills the air, Eugen balled over on the ground holding his face as blood drips from it, in the struggle to pull his spear back the young kappa had slashed across his face in its panic.</p>

          <p>Ilse dashes froward to help, as Beke in his panic and anger curses Otto, "You where told to cast protection why didn't you cast protection!" Otto knowing this is no longer part of any game despratly wishes he could of done anything at all to help, drops his wand. The young kappa no sooner had slashed the boys face free'd himself of the spear jumps on his back and stabs his webbed claws into his his neck. Blood sqeeses out of the holes and around his sharp claws, Ilse runs up to the pair and tries to pull the creature off. Beke standing before his friend screaming in pain, starts hitting the creature with his sword and stabbing at his eyes, soon the creature lets out a screech as he jumps off Eugen, who is now silent on the ground in a pool of his own blood.</p>

          <p>Effi who was suppose to be protecting her older sister had been stood still in the shock of it all, suddenly spung to life and jumped into the frey, the 3 children, Ilse, Beke & Effi beat on the monster with their swords defending with shields. The monster now hidden from view of Otto muttering magic spells he heard of from stories and Jakob collecting a few rocks from the ground, while Nils throws them at the monster where he can.</p>

          <p>In the short frenzy the creature knocks Effi aside, and makes a break for it running towards the tree line, the children give chase, Jakob bending down to pick a rock is slamed into by a fleeing monster who rips at Jakobs face and sides pulling out chunks of flesh and blood from the screaming child. The others more panicied scream and run towards the monster and Jakob Beke first, larger and stronger then the others who pushes the monster off Jakob only to recieve quick swipes towards his shield, Ilse dives in and punges her sword into the creatures left eye, it oozes out black liquid as the creature lets out a loud scream and plunges his claws into Ilse's stomach.</p>

          <p>Effi arriving later then her stronger faster comrads pushes her shield between Ilse and the creature who with his weight alone pushes them to the ground, Effi holds the shield between them trying to protect her older sister as the creature strikes down a blinding flash of light appears near the creatures one good eye and blinds it. "Heavy strike" Beke shouts as he slams his sword over the creatures head, as the creature spins and swipes its claws randomly Effi shouts "Prevoke" and feels the creature attention directly on her, dispite it being unable to see. It charges, as the creature arrives onto Effi's shield again, Ilse plunges her little toy sword into the creature's wound and its heart stops from the impact, the creature falls to the ground beathing heavily as Beke smashes his sword over its head again. It die's from blood loss shortly after.</p>

          <p>The whole encounter took just a few moments, even though to the group it felt a long time. Two of their friends lay dead in their own blood, Nils kneels by Jakobs body shivering unable to bring himself to move or speak. Beke shouts out for all to hear, blaming all of the others, until his eyes land on Eugen only then does he break, seeing his friends managled and shreaded face. Effi holds her older sister in her arms, repeating over and over that mother will be here soon, it will be okay. Ilse dies looking back at Effi unable to speak, lungs full of blood.</p>

          <p>"Level up!" the words cover Otto's vision.</p>

          <p>Soon the adults who had long heard the unusual screams come running into the clearing, shocked at the scene before them, quickly checking to the children and the monsters body.</p>

          <p>"You know what kind of creature this is?" Edmure asks. "Yeah, a Kappa, a young one at that, less then 2 years old." replies David. Edmure looks towards him and David continues. "Not native to here ofcourse I've never seen one this far south, or this far from a river, they rarely leave the waters only to snach prey or children who wonder off alone. But never this far and never before they reach adulthood."</p>
          <p>The duo stand watching the body burn. "Scouting turned up nothing, maybe it really did get driven south by the events in the north, there were no traces of other kappas in the area. That being said I have had reports of increasing monster attacks from Swexausern."</p>

          <!-- Lurking in the water is a strange child-sized humanoid that resembles a bizarre cross between a turtle, a lizard, and a monkey. It has a beak-like mouth, scaly reptilian skin, clawed and webbed hands, and a turtle-like shell on its back. In the top of its head is a bowl-like depression filled with water. -->

          <h3>Aftermath</h3>
          <!-- punishment -->
          <p>Beke outside the village hall, looking around he could see some of the children he use to play with, the older children of the area. They pay little or no attention to Beke as he comes into the hall they instead are deep into their studies or prataice.</p>

          <p>He makes his way past the children on the right praticing with swords, spears & shields. To the left children pratice copying the movements of different animals, boars, snakes, dogs, cats even rats. A look of rejection comes across Bekes face to these children doing odd movements. He arrives are the large wooden doors to the hall, *describe the hall* He makes his way inside, seeing children sitting around reading, silently, taking notes, the atmosphere in here around these children made Beke feel unconftable, not his kind of thing. Soon he finds himself stood infront of an elderly man with grey hair, a long nose, long wrinkly fingers, the old man was wearing a thick woolen cloak. Even Beke knew better then to intrupt this particular man.</p>

          <p>After a few moments the mans voice booms out "Late".</p>
          <p>"S-sorry Mr. David I had to clean as punishment for.." his eyes drift off and memories of the incident start to come back, but before he could clearly remeber.. </p>
            
          <p> "I don't want your excuses, do your cleaning then run here tomorrow. Now let's see what your apptitude is, place your hand on here, quickly now."</p>

          <p>"apptitude?" before he can talk any more his hand is dragged over a small rock, it looks like the ocean it's self is stored inside the rock, the reflection never sitting still. Soon after his hand is placed on the rock it turns to a light sea green. "Well, was not expecting that, maybe I judged you too quickly." Beke looks up confused at his statement "Sorry?"</p>

          <p>"Expected you to be a Fighter, seems you are a Rouge"</p>

          <p>"No, no, that can't be I must be a fighter, my brothers are fighters, my farther my mother, my whole family are all fighters!"</p>

          <p>"That is not how this works, Rouges are outside today, on your right as you leave, can't miss them." David goes back to his paper work. Beke looks on for a moment before realising he has been dismissed there is no arguing, he puts on foot infront of the other walking back to the door he came in from thinking over and over, no, it has to be wrong.</p>

          <p>Beke makes his way over to the Rogue group, the children around him are still moving in weird ways. The adult teaching them walks over to Beke. "So you are a Rogue then? Best to see what kind."</p>

          <p>"What kind?" Beke looks around. "Like what animal I am?"</p>

          <p>"Ahahaha, no, no. Don't know much about Rogues do you? Alright let's start from the begining"</p>

          <!-- Shit about rouges -->
          <h3>Training</h3>
          <p>While the other children trained and praticed Beke was taken to one side and asked what he knew.</p>

          <p>"So Beke why did you want to be a Fighter?"</p>

          <p>"My whole family are Fighters, I would of been a really good fighter, I am stronger and larger then the others my age."</p>

          <p>hmm I do see your point, but let me clear some things up. Firstly Rogues are not Fighters who mimic animal moves, anyone can do that. If someone want to fight while acting like a monkey or a snake that is up to them but that is not exsactly what is going on here. You see Fighters move mana thoughout their bodies to increase their speed, strength or even defend from attacks this much you might already know from your parents. A Rogue however uses their mana to repoduce how monsters fight. It's not so much about the movements but how they use their mana, let me show you.</p>

          <p>No sooner had he stopped talking a large black tail, as long as his own body had appeared behind him and slamed into the ground, the ground fell and gave way to its quick and powerful strike. "Scorpian tail, that is my spirit."</p>

          <p>"So I can grow extra body parts, parts of monsters to help me fight!?"</p>

          <p>"Aha well yes" he gesters towards his own tail. "However also no. It is not about having extra body parts, although you can, I've even seen a man who repalced his eyes with that of a bird of prey, made him an amazing archer. The point is being a Rouge is about taking what advantages a monster has and making them or own. From level 1 though to 10 we mimic the monster we want to steal from, learn how they fight so that we can kill them, eat their heart and take their spirit for our own."</p>

          <p>"Eat their heart? gain their spirit? Are you saying if I eat the heart of a dragon I can grow wings and breathe fire?"</p>

          <p>"Maybe, I never known anyone who bested a dragon in single combat and then ate the dragons heart, so what ablities and skills can be learned from a dragon I do not know. But I do know you should not pick a dragon as your first target."</p>

          <p>"I don't think a dog or a cat would suit me."</p>

          <p>"You are right about that, like you said you are big and strong, since you are later then your class mates to level you will not reach level 10 as quickly as them, prehaps you should aim a little higher, something that suits you."</p>

          <p>Beke for once in his life, stops, takes pause and thinks about what would suit him.</p>

          <p>"You don't have to decide right this second you know, there are records of other Rouges you could see what abilities they got before you decide. For today since you came with your sword and shield, let us train basic fighting."</p>

          <p>With a nod Beke agrees and joins the group.</p>

          <!-- Lunch and disscussion of the others  -->
          <p>After tranining with the others in the Rogue group, Beke started to like it, although his level was lower he was popular with the others who wanted to train against a new opponent and made a few new friends.</p>
          <p>Beke places his lunch try down and looks around at his group of Rogues, the Fighters sitting on other tables. "So where did Nils end up, as a mage?"</p>
          <p>"Oh, no he is praticing to be an artist, I hear he's going to go to the Capital to train"</p>
          <p>"Oh, what about Effi?" Beke says with a little disgust.</p>
          <p>"The stone turned red for her, Fighter"</p>
          <p>"A Fighter!? How could a coward like that become a Fighter?"</p>
          <p>Silence filled the table. "What about Otto, did he even turn up?"</p>
          <p>"... Purple, mage."</p>
          <p>"Ha! He couldn't cast a spell even WHEN his life depended on it"</p>
          <p>More silence.</p>

          <h3>departure</h3>
          <!-- departure -->
          <!-- <p>Village leader sends off all the 14 year olds. (Beke having left the year before)</p> -->
          <p>

      <!-- <p>first year of military school, need some parts about the travel above? </p> -->
      <p>Effi and her small group arrive on the outskirts of Grafen, this city has no castle instead hosting a military training camp to the north of the city. The city itself was the crossing point for the main route for trade traveling from the south of Alden to the north. It sat across the Norbadsu river which led from the West to the North. The city had walls, a large market place and a shanty town built up in the shadow of the side of the Southern wall. Grafen was inside the province of Lormersia which was the seat of Duke Reinhold of House Graf, a house that has long been counts and other forms of noblity though the ages. With a population of almost 12,000 it was the largest town in the province.</p>

      <p>The group would get oppertunity to explore the town during their two year stay here but they would infact be staying at the camp just outside of the town. Arriving at the gates to the camp they are stoped by guards before checking their belongings, papers and identies. After which they made their way into the encampment towards the paved square in the middle of the camp which was overlooked by a building which appeared to be a small palace. The plaza was filled with sevral groups of new recruits making 8 lines quing to older looking men sat behind wooden creats they used as desks.</p>

      <p>When it was Effi's turn she approached the desk she could see there was a mana stone on the desk just like the one back in the village hall, scrolls of paper and ink pots and keys. The man asked her to put her hand over the manastone, it glowed red as expected, he took her name, age & where she was from. He then handed her a scroll and a key. "Read it carefully, if you cannot read I will read it to you and then sign the bottom with your blood." Effi read though the doccument, it was as expeted a contract to join the military academy as a fighter with what was expected of her and what would be provided to her all layed out. She pricked her palm and driped the blood onto the scroll which gave off a faint light. The man took back the scroll and stored it in a crate he had behind him and handed Effi a copy. "It's not important that you keep it unless you are unsure if we are treating you baddly, in which case you will need to to refer to." She folded it neatly and placed it inside her inside pocket. She gave a quick bow to the man behind the desk who dismissed her and she went to find IIG1 the place she was allocated.</p>

      -->
      <p>Arriving at the halls, she could see rectable buildings layed out before her. 3 floors tall, not very wide but at least 5 rooms long. In the middle was a swimming pool sized grass area, with 3 buildings either side and 2 top and bottom for a total of 10 halls.</p> 
      
      <p>In the middle of the area surrounded by the buildings was a flag pole and adorning the top was a square flag with deep red background, same as the color of the manastone turns for fighters and a silver "II". Thinking to herself that this must be area II she decideds to just walk from building to building until she finds G.</p>

      <p>G was on the left side in the middle, they where in alphabetical order starting from the right handside making its way around clockwise. She firstly knocks on the door and waits and a short reply comes back though the door". "It's open you don't have to knock, you live here now" came a very confident yet not overly loud voice from beyond the door.</p>

      <p>Feeling abit embrassed Effi pushed open the door and looked around, when coming in she could see shoe shelves left and right of her, some shoes next to tags with the room numbers written on them. She found her own and put her boots and decided to leave her boots on the floor as they where quite muddy. Stepping up past he shoe racks to the left was a kitchen area and to the right was a seating area with a fireplace, although no fire was lit. Sitting inside was a boy of the same age. Very stright black hair, long ontop and spikes up towards the right, back and sides cut short pointing down. He was leading back into a chair legs crossed infrount of him without much of a care to anything. Wearing loose wollen top and tight brown leather trousers with a metal discs attached from the belt loop at the frount around and up to the belt look at the back. He had no shoes on which seem to be the house rule, bright yellow eyes, Effi had never seen another person with yellow eyes before and got very distracted by them.</p>

      <p>"If you are done staring.. allowed me to introduce myself."</p>

      <p>"I wasen't.."</p>

      <p>"Please, it's not my first time, my eyes are rare after all. Let's not lie to each other we are going to be fighting togeather soon." he stands and bows. "I am Chihiro, and no I am not from Leikia but my parents were. My role in the party is "DPS", a damage dealer."</p>

      <p> "Ah, I am Effi, I come from Steinauhau, I am going to be a tank. But how do you know we are going to be in the same party?"</p>
     
      <p> "Well there is two groups of 5 if you want to look at it that way but in the military and this academy a unit is made of 10, 5 would just be a squad. As you might of noticed there are 10 houses in II company and as you might guess 10 units makes 1 company."</p>

      <p>"Is there anything else I should know?"</p>
      
      <p>"Oh right, I mean all the military stuff I was just reading off the posters painted onto the walls" he points to large posters painted directly on the cream colored walls each with information. "They put it up so we don't forget. Appart from that I also just arrived 2 days ago, so if you like I can show you around."</p>

      <div class="pop">Poster<img height="500px" class="popOut" src="./images/ranks.png" alt="Ranks"></div>

      <p>Effi looks at a poster about the ranks in the military then turns to Chihiro and says "Please I just arrived and really want to get the dirt off myself."</p>
