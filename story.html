            <!-- Starting with the setting up of the place? and events. -->
          <p>"Congradulations!" a unified cheer rang out around the town hall, looking down into his cup David laments, the reflection looking back at him is far older then it use to be, stiff and past the age where he should be drinking luminessant green drinks, but he had always liked melon pop from his first taste over 70 years ago now. Soon the reflection in the cup smiles back. "You look happier then you have in years" his thoughts intrupted David turns to see his old friend Edmure. "I was just thinking about how new life replaces the old" he continues to smile. With a frown and then a small smile Edmure retorts "You thinking Michkels new babe is here to replace you?, there is still life left in the both of us yet". The small gathering carries on into the night. June 12th a night the people of Alden celebrate the new life brought into this world over the past year, a small tradition as not all make it past infancy.</p>

          <h3>Play day</h3>
            <!-- starting with the kids meeting as friends, introduce the town, some news the people, small parts of the world, culture-->
          <p>"Hey Karla" Michkel waves across the village square towards a tall woman holding hands with 3 children. Two older girls and a boy, all the children had red hair like their mother. As the two groups get closer Michkel nudges Sarah his wife and points to his son's smiling face, they smile to each other. "Good to see you are all well" Sarah say's towards Karla and bends down to smile at the children. "Where is Robert?" chimes Michkel. "He's going to meet us later on, went to the hall to get the news and left me alone with these loverly lot" Karla replies. The now larger group makes their way towards a near by wood, where they meet with other adults of the village and their children, the group of children run off into the forest to play as the adults make way for a fire, today is a festive day June 12th.</p>

          <!-- Children in the forest -->
         <p>The group of 7 laughing running into the forest, beyond the eyes of their parents, they arrive at a circular clear area within the small wooded area they often play. Eugen 13 years of age, larger, and taller then the others of the group, but without a temper or ambition he plays with children younger then him rarther then the older children of the village. Beke, 12 a slow child, but easily angered. Ilse 12, the oldest child of Sarah and Robert. Effi 10 the younger sister of Ilse. Otto 10 the oldest son of Michkel and Karla, with two younger brothers, and a sister on the way. Nils 10 the 8th child of the village leader, although only 5 remain. Jakob 9, A small boy, shy and ungifted.</p>

         <!-- <p>The children are armed with wood swords, shields, spears and staves. Today like most days they pretend to be heroes from old stories, facing off in small 1v1's with little orgnisation or any teams at all. After settling their small disputes and deciding who gets to be which hero they turn to battle their foe as a team. Under the command of Ilse, who while not the oldest child was Eugen had to little ambition to even lead a group as small as this and Beke who's temper is too hot to make any meaningful decisions. They charge in and out fighting a tree with a 'monster' draw onto the side.</p> -->

         <!-- What about adding the children arguing instead of jsut saying they did? -->
        
        <p>"I want to be a fighter today!"</p>
        <p>"Do you even know what fighters do? I heared your parents where farmers"</p>
        <p>"Ofcouse I know! We all went to lessons, they move the mana inside them to where it is needed to become faster or stronger" Otto replies happy with himself </p>
        <p> "You cant be a fighter, you don't have a sword, bow or anything at all! you have to be a mage, unless you want to be a rouge.." Beke snickers.</p>
        <p> Otto picks up a stick and swings it about like a sword</p>
        <p>"ahahaha" Beke burts into laughter</p>
        <p>"It's a wand. I was just testing it."</p>
        <p>"You two stop arguing and get into posistion the monster is here!" Ilse points to a tree with a monster draw onto it's side..</p>
        <p>
        That is how the team ended up with 4 melee fighters, 2 ranged fighters and 1 mage</p>
         
         <p>"Charge!" <br> "Heavy blow!" <br>  "Battle shout!" <br> "Provoke" </p>
         <p>The sounds of the fight ring out though the small clearing. "Hig-h Impact!!", "Fire Ball!". "fire ball? That's not a junior skill thats imtermediate. We all agreed to start at junior level." Berk grows towards the smaller Otto. "I thought we must of leveled up by now!" retorts Otto. "Why would we level up it's not even dead yet!" Berk shouts back. "come on now, we can't get distracted in a fight! Otto must of just got tired of being the mage every time" Ilse steps in to redirect Berks attention. "He's the mage because he cannot afford a real weapon, that is not even a wand it's just a stick" Beke spits out. Otto looks down at the stick in his hand, true enough it was no real wand. "that's what wands are, just sticks, now kill that monster!" Isle points towards the tree and Beke runs up and slams his shield into the tree and stabs it with his sword point before triumptly shouting that he had slain the monster.</p>
         <!-- The play introduces the reader in to what happens in the world, and monsters -->

          <!-- play comes to an end, the festivities start -->
          <p>As the sun reaches the middle of the sky the group run back from the forest at the smell of food, they soon catch the lights of the large fire and the food being passed around the smaller children and the adults. They pick up the pace and run over to join in the festivities.</p>

          <!-- They continue their days with the adults working, the children play or help out -->
          <!-- news could be brought back from the town hall by Robert -->
            <p>Charia Jun 12 21-22, The GrandDuchy shares a large boarder with the Principality of Huonhia to the south-east, a small boarder with the Principality of Leikia to the South. A mostly abandoned boarder with the Kingdom of Hatalisa to the west. The kingdom has recently made peace with the Pocotocotcan Theocracy, after joining forces with Leikia, Chalbia & the Mifuegan League off far to the west, the peace led Pocotcotcan to give lands to the Empire, including the trading town of Tlapatan.</p> 
                     
            <p> To the North they share another large boarder with the Heilerbach Republic, along this boarder on the Republics side has growing unrest. Due to their neighbours attention being focused west, or internally the GrandDuchy has had relative pace thoughout the past decade.</p>
            <!-- around the year 21-22 the rebelion breaks out -->

            <h3>Incident</h3>
          <!-- the incident -- re-do, the reader leaves knowing the world is not easy, the game style world they live in, charter skeletons they take with them. -->
          <p>The group are playing deep inside the forest when one of them discovers lurking near by is a leaf green figure, with a large yellow eye, webbed hands and feet with black sharp nails attached, a small belly and a slight hunchback. Its mouth shaped like bird beak but with small teeth protruding up from below. One of them shouts "monster detected!" and all the children scramble towards the creature in a charge. Unaware of the dangers of reality.</p>

          <p>Ilse shouts commands at the others to form up, and attack, ordering Otto to cast a protection spell on the Eugen, Effi to stand and protect her as she gives commands, Jakob and Nils to use their bows and for Beke Eugen to run forth and provoke the creature.</p>

          <p>At first the young Kappa is supprised and taken back by the sundden attacks and loud shouting, the children are spured on by their advantage and Beke slams his shield into the creature and stabs at its ribs with his wooden sword shouting "shield bash" with great joy. Eugen follows up by stabbing into the creature with his spear, the tip is dull but with enough force to pierce though the creatures skin, a long high screech sounds out in the clearing, confident Eugen tries to thrust further in but is unable. A toy arrow lands at Jakob's feet, Nils off into the distance. A child's cry fills the air, Eugen balled over on the ground holding his face as blood drips from it, in the struggle to pull his spear back the young kappa had slashed across his face in its panic.</p>

          <p>Ilse dashes froward to help, as Beke in his panic and anger curses Otto, "You where told to cast protection why didn't you cast protection!" Otto knowing this is no longer part of any game despratly wishes he could of done anything at all to help, drops his wand. The young kappa no sooner had slashed the boys face free'd himself of the spear jumps on his back and stabs his webbed claws into his his neck. Blood sqeeses out of the holes and around his sharp claws, Ilse runs up to the pair and tries to pull the creature off. Beke standing before his friend screaming in pain, starts hitting the creature with his sword and stabbing at his eyes, soon the creature lets out a screech as he jumps off Eugen, who is now silent on the ground in a pool of his own blood.</p>

          <p>Effi who was suppose to be protecting her older sister had been stood still in the shock of it all, suddenly spung to life and jumped into the frey, the 3 children, Ilse, Beke & Effi beat on the monster with their swords defending with shields. The monster now hidden from view of Otto muttering magic spells he heard of from stories and Jakob collecting a few rocks from the ground, while Nils throws them at the monster where he can.</p>

          <p>In the short frenzy the creature knocks Effi aside, and makes a break for it running towards the tree line, the children give chase, Jakob bending down to pick a rock is slamed into by a fleeing monster who rips at Jakobs face and sides pulling out chunks of flesh and blood from the screaming child. The others more panicied scream and run towards the monster and Jakob Beke first, larger and stronger then the others who pushes the monster off Jakob only to recieve quick swipes towards his shield, Ilse dives in and punges her sword into the creatures left eye, it oozes out black liquid as the creature lets out a loud scream and plunges his claws into Ilse's stomach.</p>

          <p>Effi arriving later then her stronger faster comrads pushes her shield between Ilse and the creature who with his weight alone pushes them to the ground, Effi holds the shield between them trying to protect her older sister as the creature strikes down a blinding flash of light appears near the creatures one good eye and blinds it. "Heavy strike" Beke shouts as he slams his sword over the creatures head, as the creature spins and swipes its claws randomly Effi shouts "Prevoke" and feels the creature attention directly on her, dispite it being unable to see. It charges, as the creature arrives onto Effi's shield again, Ilse plunges her little toy sword into the creature's wound and its heart stops from the impact, the creature falls to the ground beathing heavily as Beke smashes his sword over its head again. It die's from blood loss shortly after.</p>

          <p>The whole encounter took just a few moments, even though to the group it felt a long time. Two of their friends lay dead in their own blood, Nils kneels by Jakobs body shivering unable to bring himself to move or speak. Beke shouts out for all to hear, blaming all of the others, until his eyes land on Eugen only then does he break, seeing his friends managled and shreaded face. Effi holds her older sister in her arms, repeating over and over that mother will be here soon, it will be okay. Ilse dies looking back at Effi unable to speak, lungs full of blood.</p>

          <p>"Level up!" the words cover Otto's vision.</p>

          <p>Soon the adults who had long heard the unusual screams come running into the clearing, shocked at the scene before them, quickly checking to the children and the monsters body.</p>

          <p>"You know what kind of creature this is?" Edmure asks. "Yeah, a Kappa, a young one at that, less then 2 years old." replies David. Edmure looks towards him and David continues. "Not native to here ofcourse I've never seen one this far south, or this far from a river, they rarely leave the waters only to snach prey or children who wonder off alone. But never this far and never before they reach adulthood."</p>
          <p>The duo stand watching the body burn. "Scouting turned up nothing, maybe it really did get driven south by the events in the north, there were no traces of other kappas in the area. That being said I have had reports of increasing monster attacks from Swexausern."</p>

          <!-- Lurking in the water is a strange child-sized humanoid that resembles a bizarre cross between a turtle, a lizard, and a monkey. It has a beak-like mouth, scaly reptilian skin, clawed and webbed hands, and a turtle-like shell on its back. In the top of its head is a bowl-like depression filled with water. -->

          <h3>Aftermath</h3>
          <!-- punishment -->

          <h4>Otto POV</h4>
          <!-- a reflection for some of the others maybe about the deaths? monsters? -->
          <p>Sitting alone in his room later that night he could not help but reflect back on what was told to him earlier. The numbers displayed infront of him right now where his stats, he could even see his class, the spells he could learn in the future and last of all his level, 1.</p>

          <p class="stats">
            <li>Name: Otto.</li>
            <li>Level: 1.</li>
            <li>Primary Class: Mage.</li>
            <li>Spells: 1.</li>
            <li>Titles: 0.</li>
            <li>Spell points: 0.</li>
            <li>Stat points: 2.</li>
            <li>Stats:</li>
            <li>Strength: 0</li>
            <li>Vitality: 0</li>
            <li>Defence: 0</li>
            <li>Magic: 0</li>
            <li>MDef: 0</li>
            <li>Dexterity: 0</li>
            <li>Sense: 1</li>
            <li>Charisma: 2</li>
          </p>

          <p>He was told not to spend any of the points or learn any spells yet, that he was going to be sent to the village hall tomorrow to be tested for his aptitude and when he was 14 he would go to the magic acadamey in Banderdam.</p>

          <p>Almost all the stats where 0 however, this could not be good. Thinking at first there was a mistake he asked his parents but he soon learned that these numbers are a display of how much the mana can affect him and his spells, them being 0 just means that his mana flow to these areas is poor. The mana would not contribute toward anything he tried to do.</p>

          <p>All children growing up are told stories of heros and vilans, magic, monsters, and great warriors. But nothing was ever said about how to unlock their class, skills, or stats. Almost like everyone who had unlocked them was sworn to silence, today he found out that was true. For their own protection as the only way to unlock stats was to slay a monster in battle without the help of anyone with stats, knowing this some children might carelessly try and fight a monster before they where 14. Naturally not everyone kept the secret and most children had killed a monster before they where 14 just usually just one their parent had picked out for them, something less dangerous.</p>

          <h4>Beke POV</h4>
          <p>Beke outside the village hall, looking around he could see some of the children he use to play with, the older children of the area. They pay little or no attention to Beke as he comes into the hall they instead are deep into their studies or prataice.</p>

          <p>He makes his way past the children on the right praticing with swords, spears & shields. To the left children pratice copying the movements of different animals, boars, snakes, dogs, cats even rats. A look of rejection comes across Bekes face to these children doing odd movements. He arrives are the large wooden doors to the hall, *describe the hall* He makes his way inside, seeing children sitting around reading, silently, taking notes, the atmosphere in here around these children made Beke feel unconftable, not his kind of thing. Soon he finds himself stood infront of an elderly man with grey hair, a long nose, long wrinkly fingers, the old man was wearing a thick woolen cloak. Even Beke knew better then to intrupt this particular man.</p>

          <p>After a few moments the mans voice booms out "Late".</p>
          <p>"S-sorry Mr. David I had to clean as punishment for.." his eyes drift off and memories of the incident start to come back, but before he could clearly remeber.. </p>
            
          <p> "I don't want your excuses, do your cleaning then run here tomorrow. Now let's see what your apptitude is, place your hand on here, quickly now."</p>

          <p>"apptitude?" before he can talk any more his hand is dragged over a small rock, it looks like the ocean it's self is stored inside the rock, the reflection never sitting still. Soon after his hand is placed on the rock it turns to a light sea green. "Well, was not expecting that, maybe I judged you too quickly." Beke looks up confused at his statement "Sorry?"</p>

          <p>"Expected you to be a Fighter, seems you are a Rouge"</p>

          <p>"No, no, that can't be I must be a fighter, my brothers are fighters, my farther my mother, my whole family are all fighters!"</p>

          <p>"That is not how this works, Rouges are outside today, on your right as you leave, can't miss them." David goes back to his paper work. Beke looks on for a moment before realising he has been dismissed there is no arguing, he puts on foot infront of the other walking back to the door he came in from thinking over and over, no, it has to be wrong.</p>

          <p>Beke makes his way over to the Rogue group, the children around him are still moving in weird ways. The adult teaching them walks over to Beke. "So you are a Rogue then? Best to see what kind."</p>

          <p>"What kind?" Beke looks around. "Like what animal I am?"</p>

          <p>"Ahahaha, no, no. Don't know much about Rogues do you? Alright let's start from the begining"</p>

          <!-- Shit about rouges -->
          <h3>Training</h3>
          <p>While the other children trained and praticed Beke was taken to one side and asked what he knew.</p>

          <p>"So Beke why did you want to be a Fighter?"</p>

          <p>"My whole family are Fighters, I would of been a really good fighter, I am stronger and larger then the others my age."</p>

          <p>hmm I do see your point, but let me clear some things up. Firstly Rogues are not Fighters who mimic animal moves, anyone can do that. If someone want to fight while acting like a monkey or a snake that is up to them but that is not exsactly what is going on here. You see Fighters move mana thoughout their bodies to increase their speed, strength or even defend from attacks this much you might already know from your parents. A Rogue however uses their mana to repoduce how monsters fight. It's not so much about the movements but how they use their mana, let me show you.</p>

          <p>No sooner had he stopped talking a large black tail, as long as his own body had appeared behind him and slamed into the ground, the ground fell and gave way to its quick and powerful strike. "Scorpian tail, that is my spirit."</p>

          <p>"So I can grow extra body parts, parts of monsters to help me fight!?"</p>

          <p>"Aha well yes" he gesters towards his own tail. "However also no. It is not about having extra body parts, although you can, I've even seen a man who repalced his eyes with that of a bird of prey, made him an amazing archer. The point is being a Rouge is about taking what advantages a monster has and making them or own. From level 1 though to 10 we mimic the monster we want to steal from, learn how they fight so that we can kill them, eat their heart and take their spirit for our own."</p>

          <p>"Eat their heart? gain their spirit? Are you saying if I eat the heart of a dragon I can grow wings and breathe fire?"</p>

          <p>"Maybe, I never known anyone who bested a dragon in single combat and then ate the dragons heart, so what ablities and skills can be learned from a dragon I do not know. But I do know you should not pick a dragon as your first target."</p>

          <p>"I don't think a dog or a cat would suit me."</p>

          <p>"You are right about that, like you said you are big and strong, since you are later then your class mates to level you will not reach level 10 as quickly as them, prehaps you should aim a little higher, something that suits you."</p>

          <p>Beke for once in his life, stops, takes pause and thinks about what would suit him.</p>

          <p>"You don't have to decide right this second you know, there are records of other Rouges you could see what abilities they got before you decide. For today since you came with your sword and shield, let us train basic fighting."</p>

          <p>With a nod Beke agrees and joins the group.</p>
          <h4>Effi POV</h4>

          <p>So Strenght increase the physical damage you do, and magic how much magical damage you do. Vitality how long you can survive, this includes resistance to poisons. Magic defence, and defence are fairy self explaotory. Dexterity affects your speed, reaction time, how precice you are, thoes sort of things. Sense is not just detecting traps but senseing someones mood and many other things and finally your charisma or charm i've heard it called both but it affacts how amuable people are towards you.</p>

          <h4>Beke POV</h4>
          <!-- Lunch and disscussion of the others  -->
          <p>After tranining with the others in the Rogue group, Beke started to like it, although his level was lower he was popular with the others who wanted to train against a new opponent and made a few new friends.</p>
          <p>Beke places his lunch try down and looks around at his group of Rogues, the Fighters sitting on other tables. "So where did Nils end up, as a mage?"</p>
          <p>"Oh, no he is praticing to be an artist, I hear he's going to go to the Capital to train"</p>
          <p>"Oh, what about Effi?" Beke says with a little disgust.</p>
          <p>"The stone turned red for her, Fighter"</p>
          <p>"A Fighter!? How could a coward like that become a Fighter?"</p>
          <p>Silence filled the table. "What about Otto, did he even turn up?"</p>
          <p>"... Purple, mage."</p>
          <p>"Ha! He couldn't cast a spell even WHEN his life depended on it"</p>
          <p>More silence.</p>

          <!-- levels -->

          <h3>departure</h3>
          <!-- departure -->
          <!-- <p>Village leader sends off all the 14 year olds. (Beke having left the year before)</p> -->
          <p>
            Nils leaves for the capital to learn art 
            otto leaves for the mages academy in walled city of Banderdam 
            Effi moves to the walled city of Grafen, and the military training school. 
            Beke also moves to the walled city of Grafen and starts military training.

      <h3>Arrival</h3>
      <!-- <p>first year of military school, need some parts about the travel above? </p> -->
      <p>Effi and her small group arrive on the outskirts of Grafen, this city has no castle instead hosting a military training camp to the north of the city. The city itself was the crossing point for the main route for trade traveling from the south of Alden to the north. It sat across the Norbadsu river which led from the West to the North. The city had walls, a large market place and a shanty town built up in the shadow of the side of the Southern wall. Grafen was inside the province of Lormersia which was the seat of Duke Reinhold of House Graf, a house that has long been counts and other forms of noblity though the ages. With a population of almost 12,000 it was the largest town in the province.</p>

      <p>The group would get oppertunity to explore the town during their two year stay here but they would infact be staying at the camp just outside of the town. Arriving at the gates to the camp they are stoped by guards before checking their belongings, papers and identies. After which they made their way into the encampment towards the paved square in the middle of the camp which was overlooked by a stone building which appeared to be a small palace. The plaza was filled with sevral groups of new recruits making 8 lines quing to older looking men sat behind wooden creats they used as desks.</p>

      <p>When it was Effi's turn she approached the desk she could see there was a mana stone on the desk just like the one back in the village hall, scrolls of paper and ink pots and keys. The man asked her to put her hand over the manastone, it glowed red as expected, he took her name, age & where she was from. He then handed her a scroll and a key. "Read it carefully, if you cannot read I will read it to you and then sign the bottom with your blood." Effi read though the doccument, it was as expeted a contract to join the military academy as a fighter with what was expected of her and what would be provided to her all layed out. She pricked her palm and driped the blood onto the scroll which gave off a faint light. The man took back the scroll and stored it in a crate he had behind him and handed Effi a copy. "It's not important that you keep it unless you are unsure if we are treating you baddly, in which case you will need to to refer to." She folded it neatly and placed it inside her inside pocket. She gave a quick bow to the man behind the desk who dismissed her and she went to find 'IIG1' the place she was allocated.</p>

      -->
      <p>Arriving at the halls, she could see rectable wooden buildings layed out before her. 3 floors tall, not very wide but at least 5 rooms long. In the middle was a swimming pool sized grass area, with 3 buildings either side and 2 top and bottom for a total of 10 halls.</p> 
      
      <p>In the middle of the area surrounded by the buildings was a flag pole and adorning the top was a square flag with deep red background, same as the color of the manastone turns for fighters and a silver "II". Thinking to herself that this must be area II she decideds to just walk from building to building until she finds G.</p>

      <p>G was on the left side in the middle, they where in alphabetical order starting from the right handside making its way around clockwise. She firstly knocks on the door and waits and a short reply comes back though the door". "It's open you don't have to knock, you live here now" came a very confident yet not overly loud voice from beyond the door.</p>

      <p>Feeling abit embrassed Effi pushed open the door and looked around, when coming in she could see shoe shelves left and right of her, some shoes next to tags with the room numbers written on them. She found her own and put her boots and decided to leave her boots on the floor as they where quite muddy. Stepping up past he shoe racks to the left was a kitchen area and to the right was a seating area with a fireplace, although no fire was lit. Sitting inside was a boy of the same age. Very stright black hair, long ontop and spikes up towards the right, back and sides cut short pointing down. He was leading back into a chair legs crossed infrount of him without much of a care to anything. Wearing loose wollen top and tight brown leather trousers with a metal discs attached from the belt loop at the frount around and up to the belt look at the back. He had no shoes on which seem to be the house rule, bright yellow eyes, Effi had never seen another person with yellow eyes before and got very distracted by them.</p>

      <p>"If you are done staring.. allowed me to introduce myself."</p>

      <p>"I wasen't.."</p>

      <p>"Please, it's not my first time, my eyes are rare after all. Let's not lie to each other we are going to be fighting togeather soon." he stands and bows. "I am Naoki, and no I am not from Leikia but my parents were. My role in the party is "DPS", a damage dealer."</p>

      <p> "Ah, I am Effi, I come from Steinauhau, I am going to be a tank. But how do you know we are going to be in the same party?"</p>
     
      <p> "Well there is two groups of 5 if you want to look at it that way but in the military and this academy a unit is made of 10, 5 would just be a squad. As you might of noticed there are 10 houses in II company and as you might guess 10 units makes 1 company."</p>

      <p>"Is there anything else I should know?"</p>
      
      <p>"Oh right, I mean all the military stuff I was just reading off the posters painted onto the walls" he points to large posters painted directly on the cream colored walls each with information. "They put it up so we don't forget. Appart from that I also just arrived 2 days ago, so if you like I can show you around."</p>

      <div class="pop">Poster<img height="500px" class="popOut" src="./images/ranks.png" alt="Ranks"></div>

      <p>Effi looks at a poster about the ranks in the military then turns to Naoki and says "Please I just arrived and really want to get the dirt off myself."</p>

      <!-- layout of the camp -->
      <!-- <p>There is 8km between the main road north and the end of the province boarder where the river bends north.</p> -->
      <h4> - Change of Pov to Naoki - </h4>
      <p>"So the base is home to serval companies starting with I, II, III, IV... and so on. The layout of each of these for both the first and secound years is the same so I think we can skip visiting them all."</p>

      <p>"There are store houses, armorys and stables and just areas to store things in gernal under the walls, the archer ramparts above them. In the middle is the officers quaters, main armory and parade square. The buildings in that area are all for offerices even the pub so don't even think about joining them."</p>

      <p>"ohh do we get our on pub?"</p>

      <p>"Aha, no, unfortunatly not. We doo get some relaxtion, you may thank Leikia for the bathhouses that can be found on the south side, although there are no hot springs there is a suna and warm baths to be found."</p>

      <p>"Ah I can't wait to try them, we never had a sauna or bathhouse in Steinauhau, but why must I thank the people of Leikia?"</p>

      <p>"Well it is not appart of the normal culture here in Alden but for the people of Leikia it is intergral to their everyday lives. Now the reason we have one here is because officers of Alden who spent time in Leikia training their officers liked them so much."</p>

      <p>"I see. Well either way I cannot wait to try them" Effi gesters to her dirty attire</p>

      <p>"Aha, well yes that is why I am taking you there, I won't be joining you ofcouse the bathhouses are split by gender so get thoes thoughts out of your head. I trust you remeber the way back."</p>

      <p>Red faced Effie replies "I was thinking no such thing!"</p>

      <p>Naoki just smiles. "Well there is a small libuary if you are intrested in reading nothing but military writings. Other then that everything 'fun' is inside the city of Graf."</p>

      <p>"Do you think we will get much time off?"</p>

      <p>"3 days a month, which day depends on your secdual. If you finish in the top 10% of that month you get an extra day off. Although the examinion types change each month so it is unlikely you'll place highly every month."</p>

      <p>Effi makes a compentative face showing her dertermination to be the best. At the sight of this Naoki just rolls his eyes.</p>

      <p>"And here we are." Naoki gesters towards a wooden building intrupting the normal layout of the camp, where another companies area should of been was the bathhouses.</p>

      <p>"Thank you for showing me around" Effi bows</p>

      <p>"I did not really show you around, although I did plan on it all I did was take you stright to the bathhouse. I could smell you coming before you even knocked."</p>

      <p>Effi with a red face "Hey! It was a long journey here." Naoki just smiles and waves as he walks away.</p>

      <h3>Training</h3>
      <h4>POV Effi</h4>
      <p>As secduled, the relaxed atomsphere all ended on the first day of training. The officers had made their way back from protecting new recruits on the road to the camp, along with the secound years from missions they had been sent on during the start of June.</p>

      <p>Effi and troop where lined up in the parade ground in room order. There where to the left and right of them units from the same company, across the square where other companies all first years all with an officer standing before them. Stood above them all looking out over them a small wooden platform had been assesmbled infrount of the stone building. Upon it was the commander officer for this training regiment.</p>

      <p>His voice rang out around the parade sqaure. "Speach"</p>

    <!-- Monthly assessments in different areas -->
    <!-- Physical, magical defence, physical damage, tatical command, knolwedge, party, unit, stamnia, total defence, duels, scouting, logistics, swimming, rowing, sea battles, capture the flag -->

    <p>Company II where sent to one of the training fields around the camp. They line up all faceing foward towards the officer of their company. He was an aged man, with short grey hair, a well trimmed grey beard a heavy stare but his face still seemed friendly. He had a mix of hardened leather armor with metal plates on his elbows and under his sholder guards. Attached to his left hip was an officers single handed sword. The blade looked to be about 80cm (32 inches).</p>

    <h4>POV Change to Friedrich</h4>

    <p>"Welcome to company II. I am Friedrich Odeck, from the province of Odeck. I will be your company commander for the next 2 years. You will be taught by myself and other officers thoughout the years but I will be in charge of your wellbeing, cleanliness and dicplin"</p>
    
    <p>"I trust you have all had time to bathe, before changing into the kit provided. I see no one was foolish enough this year to turn up dressed in anything else." As I said so I was looking over the students, while most thought it was to size them up it was really to try and match their faces to the description given on the paper.Every year I would dread getting a new company, learning all their faces, personalites, names. I often wished I was like the other officers who either did not bother or called them all by the same name, but that is not my style.</p>

    <p>"Which nicely brings us to the most important part of today, the rules. They will help keep you safe, not just from accidents but also from being punished." Switching the paper from the bottom to the top to remind me of the camp rules.</p>

    <p>"During your time on duty you are to remain in the uniforms provided. This means that even when you are no longer training and just walking to the bathhouse, meeting a friend in the plaza or even in your own houses you are to wear the causal uniform provided, and when you are expected to be training with an officer you will wear the formal uniform provided. If this makes sense nod your heads in agreement." Watching the students nod I can't help but thick back to the mistakes I made my first time teaching by asking them if they understood, a mistake to be sure all I would get back is random replies and questions.</p>

    <p>"You cannot leave the camp walls without permission, this includes on your off days. If you want to leave the camp on your days off you must be signed out by an officer. For your days off to make things smoother I sign them before hand so you can collect them without disturbing me, and for thoes who are a pain I make sure to burn their slip in the fire." It's good to let them know their are concaquences, but also to follow up on them, this one is easy to remeber.</p>

    <p>"Lastly, no fighting outside of training, follow officers orders when given and clean up any mess you see, if it is your own or not. If you disagree with any of these rules or break them the reprocutions are as follows."</p>

    <p>"first a verbal warning, or gester from an officer. If you miss this warning thats your problem. Secound a verbal in your face warning, you won't miss this one and it will come with a duty you have to proform, cleaning something usually. Finally removal from the area, if you refuse to remove your self the officer *** in charge of camp behavior, or his goons will come and remove you by force. You're welcome to fight them provided you are seeking a painful and twisted death." I think I will get BBQ tonight, fed up of stew and bread.</p>

    <p>"To add to this I have my own rules. Often you hear your eldars say things like quite, which means to talk quietly. When really they want you to be silent. I will say silence when I want silence and there shall be no confusion." Roast chicken does sound good though.</p>

    <p>"When refering to officers you may call me Officer Odeck, not Friedrich. You maybe also call me Sir or Officer. If it is another officer you do not know the name off stick to Sir, Madam or Officer" I've decided it's going to be chicken.</p>

    <p>"Finally, and most importantly, don't have sex with each other, when you break up it will make everything awkuard. You have to fight as a unit together for another 2 years."</p>

    <p>"If you have questions or anything to say, raise your hand and wait silently to be called on, if not remain standing and silent." </p>

    <p>A hand goes up from F house. "Present yourself, state your name, rank and question" a student steps forward, average looking student really. Dark brown hair, brown eyes little on the skinny side.</p>

    <p>"Sigmand sir, Levi sir, So if we break the rules and get taken away, what happens to us?"</p>

    <p>Friedrich raises an eye brow and waits for the student to add "Sir" to the end of that question then replies. "Honestly, I am not too sure. Depends on what you did really. From my side all I see is that you come back ready to participate and follow orders, if it takes a week or a month or not at all, that's on you really." Well it's not a lie, I am not 100% sure in every case, they just take them to a holding area sit them against a wall and ram the desk up to them so they cannot move and are forced to work there, unless they are violent, may the god have mercy on the violent ones.</p>

    <p>Another hand goes up. "Step forth." "Hannah Sir, Levi Sir, What if we are concidently told off but not taken away? Sir"</p>

    <p>"Why? you planning on being a pain Hannah? You have a meeting with me, if that fails a meeting with my superior, if that fails. You will be whiped infrount of all the students to set an exmaple, and either kept in holding or sent to another camp."</p>

    <p>Some of the students turn a little pale from this, I imagine they have seen similar whipings used as punishemnt in their villages before. If they are from the cities I would be willing to bet on it.</p>

    <p>"Look, just don't do anything, and if you are told to stop doing something just appologise even if you don't think you where doing anything wrong. Better safe then sorry. Now let's get you training. You'll be doing one week in your roles, one week in your party, one week in your unit and then a week of assessments. Since it is week one we will be spliting up here I will stay with the support here and we will have all the Tanks over by that tree, all the DPS over by that hill."</p>
    <!-- End of Fredrich POV -->
    <h4>Effi POV</h4>
    <p>There was 20 others in the tank group, a mixture of boys and girls. Mother would often tell us tales of battles long past where the women of Alden would kill the men from their own country if he was caught fleeing from battle. I knew the stories where true but I was still expecting most of the camp to be boys, I am glad I was wrong.</p>

    <!-- maybe write this later -->
    <p>The lesson was simple, we started off comparing levels then it was about the role of tanks, what they should do during a fight. What weapons are useful and not for the role, quick pratices with all kinds of weapons and shields. After praticing with various partners and getting to know each other abit more Effi soon found out of all the tanks her level was very average if not on the low side, the instructor said they would have to work in their units to slay more monsters and level up to at least 10 by next month.</p>

    <p>Once lunch was over they went over holding the monsters attention, if the monster was to attack someone other then the tank, someone with less defence, less vitality they would die very quickly, thus the tanks job was to protect the rest of the group by holding the monsters attention and taking the damage for them. This is why the class suited Effi, she wanted to protect thoes share cared about. Protect the rest of her family from the fate her sister had met.</p>
    
    <p>With the aproval of her teacher Effi spent one of her skill points in learning the skill "Provoke" which forced a single targets focus on her for a short period of time and made her the targets first to attack in the unit. They praticed with the help of each other and the teacher until the afteroon. It was now time to go back get have a second lunch and study.</p>

    <p>Once she had made it back to her room Effi changed into her casual uniform and put her formal uniform though a quick handwash in the washing area downstairs next to the kitchen and left it out to dry. While washing her clothes she had a quick check up on her stats.</p>
<!-- Charge, Moves quickly in a straight line
Heavy blow, High damage output strike, long cool down
Battle shout, Increases the stats of allies -- not collected 
Strength up, Increases Strength(+) (Prime number str)
Vitality up, Increases Vitality(+) (Prime number vit)
High impact, Smashes the ground or target causing an AOE -- not collected until after mace
Shield Bash
Provoke, Provoke and tease them so that they want to attack you. -->
    <p class="stats">
      <li>Name: Effi.</li>
      <li>Level: 6.</li>
      <li>Primary Class: Fighter.</li>
      <li>Skills: 6.</li>
      <li>Titles: 0.</li>
      <li>Skill points: 0.</li>
      <li>Stat points: 0.</li>
      <li>Stats:</li>
      <li>Strength: 2</li>
      <li>Vitality: 8</li>
      <li>Defence: 6</li>
      <li>Magic: 0</li>
      <li>Magic Defence: 0</li>
      <li>Dexterity: 0</li>
      <li>Sense: 1</li>
      <li>Charisma: 2</li>
    </p>

    <p>She put her stat points into vitality and defence evenly until now. Now she found out that as a tank she would also be needing strenght, and possibly magic defence if they faught magic monsters, it might be a common tatic to cover for this weakness by the 2nd tank in a unit having high magic defence and her high physical but Effi wanted to be able to protect them from ALL monsters.</p>

    <p>If this was her plan, she might become a very defensive tank, but not very quick, not able to sense traps or changes and not very persuasive and would have to rely on others anyway, "why can't I just be good at everything?"</p>

    <p>Inside the common room she noticed she was not the only one who decided to study with the others and noticed that Sophia, Emilia, Ehrhart & Charlotte had also come into the common room to study. Since Effi knew Sophia the most, both being tanks she decided to see if Sophia would study with her.</p>

    <p>"Hey so, do you mind if I join you?"</p>
    <p>"Sure! you don't have to be so formal you know? You did spend 30 minutes trying to slam a sword into me just now"</p>
    <p>"Aha, well trying is the keyword there.." Sitting down at the table with Sophia, Effi lays her three books and sits.</p>
    <p>"You brought the rules book with you?"</p>
    <p>"Oh I kinda just grabbed all of them."</p>
    <p>"Well I was reading though the historys if you want we could pick out paths that suit ourselves and maybe compliment each other since we will be fighting togeather"</p>
    <p>"oh that sounds like a good idea, I kinda know what I want, well the result anyway I am just not sure about how to get there. What skills to pick up, what balance my stats should be..."</p>
    <p>"I think we are all in that boat, well most of us anyway. Charlotte over there is unsure of even were to start" At the menction of her name Charlotte just smiles, reading the historys also.</p>
    <p>"Yeah, picking out what you want to do with the rest of you life right now is really stressful.."</p>
    <p>"Well I am thinking a large battle axe alot of strength and vitality, the power to shake the very ground with my blows, kind thing excites me. What did you have in mind?"</p>
    <p>"Oh wow that sounds badass! I was thinking a big shield with a longsword."</p>
    <p>"hmm, I mean would you take some advice from me? from what I saw today you are naturally quite strong but not very fast. That was why your strikes where very easy to avoid or push away maybe a sword isant your thing but something...heaveier? so you can put that strength to use."</p>
    <p>"Ah, yeah mother always said I was slow with a sword, but until now I never tried any of these weapons before.. I'll read the historys with you now and see what I should do at level 10 maybe it will help me make a choice"</p>
    <p>"Sounds like a good idea"</p>

    <h4>Dinner time</h4>
    <p>"I cannot decide"</p>
    <p>"On your sub-class?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah, Paladin or Knight, Paladins are greay they protect people and have great defencice and even some healing skills but are so inflexable where as kights have so much freedom."</p>

      <h3>Missions</h3>
    <!-- defeating monsters in the local area -->
    <h4>POV - </h4>
    <p>One week after the start of lessons they all students where moved from their classes in their roles into their parties of 5. They had four days to pratice and get their teamwork togeather because on the 5th day they would be fighting a real monster togeather. Company II had decided on teams of:</p>

    <p>Effi, Naoki, Alajos, Johannes & Konrad.</p>
    <p>Sophia, Emilia, Klara, Charlotte & Ehrhart.</p>

    <p>Fredrich - "So to repeat what you have to do in short, learn to work togeather as a functional team, there are various activies you will be assigned to each whole or half day depends on the activity. I will be around but unable to simpley stay with each party all the time that would be unfair on the others. Take the activities seriously even if they are fun, difficult or boring" as on the 5th day your life might depend on it. Dismissed."</p>

    <p>In turn the team captain from each team made their way to the front and picked up a wooden baton with an activity on the reverse side.</p>

    <p>"What did we get?"</p>
    <p>"Assualt course, half day. Swap with puzzles"</p>
    <p>"So we have to complete and assult course as a team?"</p>
    <p>"Well yeah I guess it so"</p>
    
    <p>After ariving at the assult couse it because very clear this was not something someone could do solo. Their first obstical alone was a giant wall higher then any two of them even stood atop each other.</p>
    <p>"So... Thoughts, ideas?"</p>
    <p>"Well if we can get one or two of us up there, even then if they hand there hands down unless any of you can jump twice your own height..."</p>
    <p>"Let's see if we can get someone on top maybe there is more to this."</p>
    <p>"Well Effi well have to hold whoever goes up, but we will need another ontop of her for them to be able to make it to the top."</p>
    <p>"Why am I on the bottom!?"</p>
    <p>"You're the studest... You are the Tank."</p>
    <p>"...stuiped logic"</p>
    <p>"I'll stand in the middle, to give 'support' to the one that goes up"</p>
    <p>"Was that a pun about your role?"</p>
    <p>"Just get on with it"</p>
    <p>Effi is stood with Konrad standing on her sholders with Naoki and Johannes holding them from either side. Alajos starts climbing up them thinking this would of been easier if he started on top, once he climbs ontop of Konrads sholders he grips onto the top of the wall and pulls himself up.</p>
    <p>"So, what can you see?"</p>
    <p>"Another wall"</p>
    <p>"Don't joke whats up there"</p>
    <p>"It was not a joke."</p>
    <p>The group fall silent. Suddenly the end of a rope falls down from over the wall. "One at a time, there is no where to tie the rope onto so its just me holding it."</p>

     <p>Once atop the wall they could see Alajos was not joking it was another wall, but thankfully this one had a door inside.</p>
     <p>"So what is it this time?"</p>
     <p>"well truth be told the only thing up here was that rope, so let's try the door."</p>
     <p>Opening the door the party made their way inside, inside was a pathway that they could see the end of, it led to a cave exiting out the otherside and the sunlight could be seen pouring inside. The only issue was that the pathway was not wide, infact it was as wide as a person foot was wide. and on one side was a sheer drop and the other a wall.</p>
     <p>"So, think the rope is long enough to reach the other end?"</p>
     <p>"Nope, not even half way."</p>
     <p>"Should we go one at a time?"</p>
     <p>"and if you should slip and fall we morn you one at a time?"</p>
     <p>"I was only asking.."</p>
     <p>"Sorry, it just kind of came out. We are meant to do this togeather, theres enough rope to wrap around each of us so we are tied togeather and walk across togeather. If one of us should slip the others could help them stay up"</p>
     <p>"And if two of us slip?"</p>
     <p>"mm just dont think like that"</p>
     <p>"So, since the officers made this, do you think the drop is really fatal, I mean how far down could it even be, we only climbed one wall."</p>
     <p>"I mean, only one way to find out. I can't see the bottom but once you are down there you could shout back up how far it is."</p>
     <p>"I get the point"</p>
     <!-- puzzles -->

     <!-- giant wall, river, skyscraper, lasers, trap areas,  -->

     <p>"What even this time?"</p>
     <p>"Make a camp, campfire, tents, food, water and sleep there for the night."</p>
     <p>"Sounds easy enough?"</p>
     <p>"Don't jinx it."</p>

     <p>Arriving at the campsite they could not help but question if it was the right place, just down from the river and next to the forest in the east side of the camp. There was no equipment, no food, no water nothing. </p>
    <!-- camping stay the night  -->
    <p>"Are we at the right place?"</p>
    <p>Konrad - "Yeah, I spoke to some of the girls from the other team, apperently you get nothing and can bring nothing to this activity. You just have to make what you can with your skills."</p>
    <p>"So thats what you were doing with thoes girls"</p>
    <p>"Mostly, but I don't kiss and tell."</p>
    <p>Effi starts fake vomiting</p>
    <p>Naoki - "Putting aside the fun, I don't want to sleep on the wet grass. So what skills do any of you have that could help us here?"</p>
    <p>Effi - "Well, I have heavy blow. It stikes a target for high damage, it never said I had to use a weapon or the target had to be living. Maybe I can cut us some wood?"</p>
    <p>Johannes - "I can sort of clean the river water by purifing it, but the mana cost is high. Just to be safe we should also boil it."</p>
    <p>Konrad - "Not really a skill, but I can track down food. My sense is quite high and I did pretty well back in my home town. I also learn the tracking skill, I just haven't made up my mind yet."</p>
    <p>Alajos - "While Konrad collects the vegtables and berries I can hunt. I have the spear throw skill and tracking skill, kind of must haves if you are going to live in Chinga...Northen Alden. Long live the GrandDuchy."</p>
    <p>The group fall into an awarkud silence at the reminder of how the people of the old state of Chingaling are treated.</p>   
    <p>Naoki - "Effi, wood for fire, Johannes water, Konrad food, Alajos hunt until midday then make your way back for lunch even if you catch nothing and we can decide on how far we have all made progress before splitting up again. I will work on our acamadations."</p>
    <p>Konrad - "sounds good"</p>
    <p>Effi - "I'll get chopping!"</p>
    <p>The group go their serpate ways.</p>
     <!-- follow pov char -->

     <!-- lunch time -->
     <p>At just past midday they make their way back to the meeting point, the place they agreed to make camp, Naoki had dug a small hole between two trees, and placed logs around the edges. On the bottom was layed sticks and leaves intertwined, the roof was partally built sloping off to one side made currently just out of sticks and a rope like plant.</p>

     <p>Alajos "Hey Naoki that's really impressive"</p>
     <p>"Thanks Alajos, you had luck hunting I see"</p>
     <p>Alajos - "No luck, all talent."</p>
     <p>Alajos - "Now help me skin these things we can eat the rabbit now, the birds tonight."</p>
     <p>Naoki - "Yeah alright"</p>
     <p>"The shelter will keep the rain of us, what should we do for warmth?"</p>
     <p>"Fire, body warmth and hopefully I can get some help making small blankets out of these plants."</p>
     <p>"I'll give you a hand after, not sure the Alden's have any pratice at making their own shelter."</p>
     <p>"Ha, that is true thanks man."</p>

     <p>Late that night the party are sitting around eating the berries, vegtables and birds by fireside. The sun had gone down and Fredrich had come to visit them.</p>
     <p>Fredrich - "Evening all."</p>
     <p>The party stand, salute and greet their commander. "Sir!"</p>
     <p>Fredrich - "Good, sit. Now the night will be cold, somewhere around 5 or 6 degrees. While your accomadations look promising I decided to bring you blankets. Tell no one." Fredrich dumps a package of blankets wraped with string into Naoki's lap, as soon as he does he turns and walks back to the camp.</p>
     <p>"Well that was unexected."</p>
     <p>"But very welcome, let's get to bed"</p>

     <!-- Monster fight -->

     <p>Effi picked up a baton from the table and took it back to the group. Turning it over infrount of all of them they could see what monster they would have to fight.On the back side was a picture of a of a wild dog-like animal with a tail longer then its body. One word below it Ahuizotl.</p>

     <p>"What is this?"</p>
     <p>Alajos - "Ahuizotl, It's a strong monster. From the jungles of Chaibia, thick fur that acts as its defence against mosst weapons, small ears and a long tail or in this case 2, at the end of which will either be a hand like paw or stinger. Both are dangerous, its element is water, usually they hide in the depths and drag men under with their hand like tail."</p>

     <p>"So what should we do to prepare?"</p>
     <p>Alajos- "Hmm if its the stinger we will need cures for poison, if its the hand, chances are its a water arena and we will need to prepare for that, hard to say."</p>
     <p>Naoki - "I think we should level up, getting some of us to level 10 will really help."</p>
     <p>"You are not wrong but how do we do that?"</p>
     <p>Naoki - "The orders where to prepare for the upcoming fight, it never spcifed how. Why don't we go and hunt monsters?"</p>
     <p>The group reflect on Naoki's suggestion, after agreeing to it they go to Fredrich and ask for passes to leave the camp.</p>

     <h4>POV </h4>
     <p>Fredrich - "Well, you are not wrong, or even the first to ask. It is unusual for first years to take up monster slaying missions so early on, but I won't stop you, just suggest that you stick to missions in the 0-10 range. Even if you are in a group, level 10 is such a large change that it might be too difficult."</p>
     <p>Taking the slips the party bow and thank their officer.</p>

     <p>"Which mission did you grab?"</p>
     <p>"Well the choice was slimes or living mushrooms, that was all that was in our rank range. So I picked the mushrooms, levels range from 0 to 5."</p>
     <p>"Let's get to it!"</p>

     <p>After searching though the woods in the area given to them on a map the party soon came across a group of living mushrooms, Effi quickly used charge and glided into the first living mushroom smashing into it with her shield grabbing the attention of the monsters.</p>

     <p>Naoki runs up behind Effi and strikes the first monster with his katana, Naoki soon pulled back when he realised he had done less then 3% damage to the monster.</p>

     <p>Konrad and Alajos both use charge at the same time to move into range of the mushroom and attack using "quick strike" cutting the hp of the mushroom down by 6% each.</p>

     <p>Johannes used "quick strike" with his bow and arrow stuck the monster for another 6%. "This is going to take awhile"</p>

     <p>Soon enough the mushrooms fight back sending spores into the air and the closets charges awkuardly head first at Effi. Who just allowed it to slam into the shield and hit down ontop of it with her sword using "heavy strike".</p>

     <p>"Did it hurt how much damage?"</p>
     <p>"1 hp. I think we can just slaughter them, Johannes you got our backs if we mess up?"</p>
     <p>Johannes - "I am sure I can out cure 1 hp dammage"</p>
     <p>The group fight their way though the mushrooms easily, after having completed the mission they make their way back and grab another. Over the course of the week the group managed to level a few times but did not once try to fight anything above level 9.</p>

      <p>"Oh! Congradulations, what sub-classes will you two pick!?"</p>
      <p>Alajos - "Huszár ofcourse."</p>
      <p>Naoki - Waving his katana around "Samurai, like you even had to ask" he laughs.</p>

      <h4>POV</h4>
      <p>"How long until the fight?"</p>
      <p>"We are up next so as soon as the other party finish we go on after."</p>
      <p>"Ah I hate the waiting.."</p>

      <p>"Company II, Unit G, Part 1."</p>
      <p>"Well that's us, lets go."</p>
      <p>Making their way onto the arena, infrount of them was a cage holding a twin-tailed Ahuizotl. Its fur was a dark blue, eyes black, so black there where no other shades of color inside. The two tails circled around over its head poised to stike.</p>
      <p>Effi takes to the front while as praticed Naoki supports her from her right side, her weakest side. For this fight Effi swapped her sword for a large one handed mace, hoping this was the right call to make since the Ahuizotl's fur made using slashing weapons very hard.</p>

      <p>Once the fight started the Ahuizotl wasted no time in pouncing towards Naoki only to be "provoked" by Effi, The first attack came in the form of two claws which struck down on her shield. Naoki saw his oppertunity and unleased a a devistating "quick draw" into the monsters nose, the damage was done and first blood was drawn. With a quick whip of its tail two stigers where sent flying towards Effi and Naoki, the former who took the hit with her shield and the latter with his sholder.</p>

      <p>While Naoki fell down in pain Johannes shot loose an arrow of healing which stuke Naoki in the back causing the wound to heal slowly, the only problem was the poison was still taking his life.</p>

      <p>Alajos had not been idle using his new increased speed to sweep around and launch an attack from the monsters flank, stiking with his saber into the monsters rear leg. When the monster spun to attack him he made a hasty retreat back to Konrad, who had arrived with a light thin sword in one hand and a bag of powder in another. He quickly threw the powder into the monsters face after it had turned to help Alajos's escape.</p>

      <p>Effi who was angered by her partners injury and having lost the monsters attention used "Heavy blow" into the monster behind, the heavy mace was very effective the feeling of crushing bones and flesh came back as a responce, she followed this up with a "shield bash" into the monsters face as it tired to turn around. Now with its full attention Effi continues to attack with her heavy mace.</p>

      <p>Johannes moves to pull back Naoki, he insists he is okay the officers will pull him out if is hp drops below 20%, he moves back behind Effi and stikes to cover her weaknesses. Alajos moves in and out striking from the flank and sides of the monster. Konrad moves in to deploy spikes onto the ground, he is a little too agressive and the monster lands a strike with his tail onto konrad, Johannes keeps him from falling too low but the tacs are deployed poorly.</p>

      <p>The monster moves to jump and bite down on Effi's sword arm but it is quickly met by Naoki's sword and a cut is left across the monsters eye. Konrad who has been weakned moves back only for the monster to to retreat from Naoki's blow, with the tacs now layed between Effi and Konrad.</p>

      <p>The monster jumps to Konrad, unable to move in and grab the attention of the monster because they could not move easily though the tacs and chose to move around Konrad's scream rang out around the area has the bite had gone deep into his arm, his sharp sword in though the monsters thoat.</p>

      <p>Effi slams the mace into the side of the monsters face to get him to back up and release Konrad, amazingly it works. Johannes tries to heal Konrad has his hp hovers around 30%. Effi enraged gives chase and "charges" after the monster.</p>

      <p>The monster bleeding from the neck turns and charges into Effi, but it is of little use to fight with its claws or mouth against Effi's shield, but its tails can make it around the shield. Alajos moved in quickly to deal as much damage as he could to the monsters legs, they where cut and weak from Alajos's repeat attacks.</p>

      <p>Alajos shouts "Watch out! Breath attack!" The monsters jaw opend unrealistly wide, a blue watey mist came out of the monsters breath. Effi jumped back in supprise as Naoki moves in and lunges his sword into the monsters mouth before dispearing into the miss and a bright light.</p>

      <p>Effi shouted and ran in a charget towards the monster, though the breath she felt her movments become slower the moment she came into contact with the breath. Naoki was on the ground near by and the monster had now a slash across both its eyes. Faliling around attacking randomly at any and all noises Effi banged her mace against her shield to keep its attention. Johannes quickly fired shots into Naoki once the mist had cleared up, the monsters hp was getting low, blood pouring from its neck, both eyes injured and its back legs shreaded. Alajos and Konrad charged in landing heavy & quick blows onto the monster its hp soon wilted down to nothing.</p>

      <p>The party had, with the safty next of the staff and officers defeated a level 10 opponent for the first time, and realised how large the jump was between their abilities and monsters of the same level. It took 5 of them to take down just 1 monster of similar level.</p>

      <p>With the joy of victory came more fruit for Effi as she too had finally become level 10 and was able to pick her sub-class.</p>

            <h2>Otto - first year</h2>
          </header>
          <h3>Travel</h3>

          <p>The students of the village would all head off on the same day, they would travel to seprate destinations and along the way change the adults traveling with them, at first the instructors of the village hall travled with them until they reached the town of Todtenwei. From there they would change guardians every town/village or city until their destinations. Between Todtenwei and Shomberg was the 2nd Regiment of Aldens camp, there where many Fighters who would join the training camps near by and once the remaineder of the group joined the main road south they lost the majority of the other students are the large Grafen military training camp. The group would further split at the Lobach river where the 3rd regiment of Alden where based, thoes heading north from here went to the capital Alden or Banderdam near the Mages academy. South would be heading Haisengen and then into Huonhia. The group would continue to split and have new students join all the way until Argavereri. Although the jorney to this point had been as expected where small monsters where driven off by the numbers or guardians the road to Banderdam traveled close to Huonhia and near an area often overrun by monsters. It was a rainforest where a few major rivers became one and followed into the sea, if it where not for the abundance of monsters it is likely this would be the location of some major cities.</p>

          <p>Otto found himself walking next to a tall boy with short brown hair. He had the makings of a small mustashe on his upper lip, a refined pointed nose and a bit of achne around his cheeks.</p>
          <p>"Names Leon, if you care to ask"</p>
          <p>"Oh sorry, was I stareing?"</p>
          <p>"Maybe a little, and we have been walking next to each for for 2 days now."</p>
          <p>"Ah, I am sorry..."</p>
          <p>"It's fine, you from far? you look tired, like you have been walking for awhile."</p>
          <p>"Steinauhau"</p>
          <p>"...Dosen't get much further then that in Alden, you ever been to Chingaling land before?"</p>
          <p>"Chingaling? I am going to Tirnavalli Dukedom. Banderdam."</p>
          <p>"Ah, sorry forgot my place, thats correct, how silly of me."</p>
          <p>"What is Chingaling land?"</p>
          <p>Leon stared at Otto. "You really don't know?"</p>
          <p>"Woudln't of asked if I did."</p>
          <p>"Suppose so, thought you were just a die hard Alden, well Chingaling was a country before, made up of people from Hathapatson to Dodgud. Alden and Huonhia split the country in two and claimed it for their own. Although the offical story is the people of Banderdam where demon worshipers so Alden occupied that area and Huonhia occupied the rest to protect the people from Alden. I suppose the truth depends on who you ask."</p>
          <p>"So you must be local then?"</p>
          <p>"Aha, yeah, born in Banderdam. Still live there now with my little sister and little brother."</p>
          <p>"Erm your parents?"</p>
          <p>"Monsters, Ethautenheim to Banderdam passes though the province of Bilkotgopia. Risky trip but pays well, work at Banderdam depends on the ports and the academy. Both do poorly in the winter."</p>
          <p>"So you make this trip every year?"</p>
          <p>"First time. I didn't dare go outside of when the students travel, less guards. Less of the ones that will help you anyway."</p>
          <p>"Makes sense you can blend in easily becasue of your age, is it not a risk for you to tell me all this?"</p>
          <p>"No, not particularly. It is no crime to travel at the same time, and traveling in numbers offers its own kind of protection."</p>
          <p>"Well I am glad to have you with me, if we get lost you must know the area."</p>
          <p>"That is true, but I am no fighter, I am training as a shop keeper, an apprentise. You know, if I get back."</p>
          <p>"You'll make it back, I am sure. There are nobles kids in this group the guard's won't let the monsters near them."</p>
          <p>"Yes, near them. But we are not them."</p>
          <p>Otto pauses to think, he has a point but if we are just near by they will have to protect us even if they don't mean to.</p>

          <p>Leon - "you're a mage with no wand? I think that is fine I have seen loads of mages without wands. If you really have to have a wand you can pick one up in Banderdam, being so close to the Mages collage means they often stock thoes kind of things."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I still want to get one though"</p>
          <p> Leon - "Yeah, looking at Pal's shop it seems many students think the same way, maybe it's the books they make you all read brainwashing you into buying wands."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Aha, you might be right you know, we all have to read the same books to start with."</p>
          <p>Otto - "There is alot of noise coming from thoes nobels up ahead. Didn't think they could get any louder."</p>
          <p>Leon - "Drunk no doubt. Sounds like they are play fighting."</p>
          <p>Otto and Leon turn to look at each other realising there is no way they are play fighting like little kids at a time like this.</p>
          <p>Leon - "Into the northen tree's, if we are lucky we can go around."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Won't there just be more monsters in the trees?"</p>
          <p>Leon - "Chance of monsters is still lower then definatly monsters"</p>
          <p>Otto - "But the guards." Before Otto can finish his sentance he see's a nobels guard cut down a 14 year old girl from neck though the body and out though the opposite side just above the hip. To far to hear what the guard said it looked as if they had turned on the other students. Following Leon, Otto ran as fast as he could until they where just beoynd the sounds of metal, shouts and screams.</p>
          <p>Sitting inside of a ditch with hastily assembled twigs, leaves and dirt above their heads Otto was looking pale as Leon tried to slow his breathing.</p>
          <p>Leon - "Welcome to Bilkotgopia."</p>
          <p>Otto - "That some kind of joke?"</p>
          <p>Leon - "Yeah, sorry. A dark one, close to the truth. In Bilkotgopia people go missing, it's always blamed on the monsters but strong monsters rarely travel accross into Alden."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Truth and lies must be hard to tell appart here."</p>
          <p>Leon - "Yeah, at least im upfront about which side I am on, I won't be turning against you. I just want to go home."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Like you said you are not a fighter, but can you guide us to the river just past this... mess"</p>
          <p>Leon - "Polite way to put it, but yes I can. After that we follow the river takes us to Banderdam."</p>
          <p>Otto - "The river safe?"</p>
          <p>Leon - "Ahum.. once we get out of Bilkotgopia it is."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Let's move before we have time to take in what happend or worse it comes this way."</p>
          <p>Leon nods and they crawl out and make their way though the forest towards the river, any sound of battle had died out they where too far from the road now to hear anything anyway. After 90 minutes of walking they where getting to where they wanted to be, Leon had been following signs and markings left behind by his people, signs to help them avoid the guards but Otto did not need to know that.</p>
          <p>Leon - "Can you hear. Moaning?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Like an old man waking up."</p>
          <p>Pushing appart the brances Leon peered forward and infrount of him on the ground was a dead student & the upper half of a dead man. The dead student was a first year, 14 years old like all the others the same age as Otto and Leon. She had light brown hair, slim body and face, with a small pointed nose. The half of the man that was left had blood seeping out of the cracks between his burnt skin, there was no hair on his body and his lower lip was completly removed along with his ears. He was currently eating the girls insides though her belly tearing at the flesh with his hands of bone and burnt rotten flesh, shoveling the meat into his mouth where most of it ended up back inside the girl though the gaps in his teeth.</p>
          <p>Leon vomited, loudly. The monster screamed towards Leon and dragged it's self at supprsing speed towards him. Otto having seen Leon vomit had rushed over to help him, upon hearing the scream and seeing the moving cadaver chaseing them down he tried to push his mana though his body and out of his hand like he had with the Kappa. The rush felt easier this time with all the pratice he had had the ball of light shined, pale blue glow shone off the ground and trees before the ball spiraled forward blinding the monster for a moment giving Otto the chance to free Leon of his short sword, Otto ran towards the monster and kicked dirt up into its eyes and mouth, it flailed about and pushed the dirt from its eyes before showing his teeth in a growl. Using this time Otto ran in a circle to the side of the monster before turning on his heel, running stright for the monster holding the blade by his side and lunging it into the creatures head.</p>
          <p>Otto wondered if there would be another level up or notification, but nothing happend. Letting go of the blade and turning to help Leon back up Otto heared a low growl and turned to see the monster was not dead and moving about with a sword sticking out from its head. Otto jumped around as the monster made swings from the ground before grabbing hold of Leons sword again and swining it smashing the monsters head to pieces over and over.</p>

          <p>Leaving Leon against a tree to recover himself Otto starts to search the dead student, finding on her some coins, accessories and a few school supplies and food.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Guess she wasen't a rich girl." Grabbing the ID card 'Lea Müller'. "You know her?"</p>
          <p>Leon - "No, Alden name, not from here."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Makes sense, can't carry her so I will take the ID card to the town and report shes dead or something. Let's get out of here."</p>

          <p>Making their way back to the river Otto and Leon where on the otherside of the river to the main route. Since they had passed into Tirnavalli they could see a few boats moving down the river, and a few coming up. They manage to flag down some passing guards and explained their story to them, Otto gave over the students ID and told them where they could find the bodies. Otto and Leon then joined them in the boat on the way to Banderdam. </p>

          <h3>City of Banderdam</h3>
          <p>Arriving before the city of Banderdam where trails of students heading to the academy which lay near the city. The city itself was across a small stone bridge across the river Chitna which ended just short of the citys gate house where a wooden drawbridge made up for gap. There where square shaped towers all around the walls spaced appart, with a wooden building built atop. The gate house seem to of been rebuilt with diffrent color to it, the towers were circular with stone walls to the pointed rooves. There was a walled and rooved walkway between the two towers visable from the outside as it ran over the gate house giving the defenders room to drop things onto attacks. Even the older towers and walls had maticulations.</p>
          <div class="pop">Banderdam<img class="popOut" height="400px" src="./images/sergei-panin-04.jpg" alt="Banderdam"></div>

          <p>After getting out of the boat at the tempary station set up to deal with the large influx of people Leon and Otto made there way to the town by foot.</p>

          <p>Once at the gate, guards where outside checking people coming into the city. With his ID card, letters of introduction to the magic academy and his age it was easy for Otto to pass though the gate. Leon livied there so he was able to pass though the smaller gate for the locals. Meeting up again inside Leon took Otto to the shoping distrct so he could drop off his package and Otto could go shopping for a wand.</p>

          <p>The town inside was packed, the buildings clearly had been built with space between them to avoid fires but smaller tempary stuctures, carts and peaddlers had set up in thoes spaces selling and buying goods coming and going from the ports of Tirnadepal and Tirnavalli. There were ofcouse also goods being sold espcially this time of year for new and old students entering the academy.</p>

          <p>Leon had taken Otto to a wand shop that had been there since before Banderdam was appart of Alden. Inside was clean, really clean. Not a single spec of dust was anywhere to be found, the wands were displayed around the shop in glass cases and up on the walls in glass cases. Each wand had a card next to it with its discription and price.</p>

            -->

            <p>To put it bluntly, it was hard to miss. That wand stood out from the others, and not in a way that made him want to buy it. While thinking what kind of mad man would make such a thing let alone sell it his thoughts where intrupted.</p>
            <p>"First time? I wouldn't reccomend that particular one"</p>
            <p>"Uh yeah, it's my first time here. I won't be getting that one, what even is it?"</p>
            <p>"Ah, not all items are made, some are dropped by monsters so it's hard to say. Let me help you out, this is my shop I can do at least that much, names Pal" He said his hand streched out.</p>
            <!-- pall means Tiny, petite -->
            <p>True to his name he was a small man no more then 150cm, Otto reached out and shook his hand.</p>
            <p>"So first tell me, do you know what field you would like to go into?"</p>
            <p>"I am not too sure myself, I know I want to take the elements eletric & wind."</p>
            <p>"Ah, a battle mage then?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, sorry I should have specified."</p>
            <p>"A mage who appologises, rare."</p>
            <p>"Are other mages rude? Is it only thoes with bad parents who become mages?"</p>
            <p>"Ahaha, might be so, we just say it is because they think they are gifted more then others. Makes them arogent, if you keep away from being arogent and stick to what you want, you might jsut accieve it. But don't speak like that around other mages, you won't make friends that way ahaha."</p>
            <p>The shop keeper layed out 3 wands before Otto. "Nothing quite as fancy as some of the other wands, but at least useable by a beginer. Now I should explain the stats displayed are reflective of my measurements, thats to say how much it would increase by stats by just to give people a point of reference. The stats for when you hold it will be reflective of your own level."</p>
            <p>"Oh, I did not know that.. Can I ask, what level are you?"</p>
            <p>"33, I have spent more of my life as a shop keeper, item collector and appraiser. Combat magic is not my specality. I would of liked to of gotten a secound element but as you can see I did quite well enough without it." The old shop keeper smiled.</p>
            <p>"I cannot deny that." looking at the wands they had the cards displaying: {+3 Magic.}, {Once per day skill: Detect magic (1).}, {Once per day skill: Small gust (1).} Each had their own uses, the first wand would give Otto +0 magic until he reached level 10 however, but every 1 magic at any level is always a boon. Detect magic would be great if he ever got to go on a mission in helping find anything magical, and without having to spend a spell point to learn it. Small gust was a wind element skill, a support skill, all it did was as it was named, a small gust of wind would pass by, maybe to pick up sand or drit and throw it into the targets eyes, or dry clothes. Even so to find an elemental item a beginer can use was rare.</p>
            <p>"Ah you like that one? Hard to find an elemental wand that anyone can use, but since it is a first level spell it is something you can learn for free."</p>
            <p>"Not free, costs a point."</p>
            <p>"That, is true."</p>
            <p>"How much are they?"</p>
            <p>"Same price, ¤100,000"</p>
            <p>"Less then I thought, more then I have."</p>
            <p>"Only students from nobel houses pay with cash anyway, if you sign for something I can collect it later at the academy and they take it from your mission rewards, until they are paid back. Don't go crazy though they won't loan a first year more then ¤100,000."</p>
            <p>"Good thing the prices match then."</p>
            <p>"Don't look at me like that, I already discounted them so you could afford it if you like them, I won't force you, no doubt you will be coming back for many years."</p>
            <p>"Ah, thank you" Otto bows deeply. "Could I buy the detect magic wand?"</p>
            <p>"Feeling you might get lucky on a mission?"</p>
            <p>"The opposite, feel like I will be unlucky and not spot something."</p>
            <p>"It's yours, if I where you I'd keep it to yourself. Although it gives you access to the skill, still costs mana, you have to push your mana into the wand, though it and out the otherside. Normally I ask people not to test wands in here but in this case it won't do any harm so give it ago."</p>
            <p>"If you are sure." Otto pushes his mana into the wand, it flows though like his arm is longer then normal feeling appart of him as far as the mana is conserned and out the otherside where upon Otto's eye sight is filled in color. Almost all objects in the shop glow different strange colors.</p>
            <p>"Quite the show isan't it? Almost every item in here contains magic so, thats why."</p>
            <p>"Why are there so many colors?"</p>
            <p>"Different types of magic, like the manastone when you touch it turns purple-ish right?"</p>
            <p>"Yeah"</p>
            <p>"Well" taking a mana stone out from his desk and leaving it in the palm of his hand, the stone turns from its usual sea blue to dark forest green."Wood is my element."</p>
            <p>Otto nods in understanding. After thanking the shop keeper again and leaving the shop with his new wand hidden away, heading to meet Leon at 'Főzelékfaló' a small cafe in the castle area, he ordered Főzelék as Leon had reccomended it. An intresting experience, tasted like thick vegtable stew although that discription does it little justice, so Otto became desprate to learn how to make it.</p>

            <div class="pop">Főzelék<img class="popOut" height="400px" src="./images/Főzelék.jpg" alt="Főzelék"></div>

            <p>"Good isan't it?"</p>
            <p>"Yeah, I don't really know how to describe it, can you make it?"</p>
            <p>"Yeah I can, but not as well. If you want to learn my sister will be able to show you, I am sure you will get time to come visit us the minimum stay in the acadey is 2 years after all."</p>
            <p>"I will, it's not like there are other towns near the academy, so I guess I will be coming often."</p>
            <p>"Aha you're welcome to, but you studies might be a little more intense then you think."</p>

            <p>After thanking Leon showing him where to get a good meal, and introducing him to a realiable shop keeper. Otto's jorney to the Academy was only a few short hours walk from Banderdam, although the other students often chose to spen their money on rented mounts, Otto could not ride, and was bankrupt.</p>

          <h3>Acadamey</h3>
          <p>The acadamey at first appeared to be a large and quite impressive but much smaller building than expected, situatied inside the rainforest Banderdam was famous for. With tall tress hiding the building from a clear view, as you got closer to the building you could see vines growuping up the side of the stone work, towers with no tops poked out from behind here and there, the place appeared to be in ruin in areas. Students could be seen on mounts, in carriages or on foot, unloading near the entrance. There where two large doors left wide open, standing near by where men dressed in an assortment of all different colors most in robes but a few in metal armor. Inside of the two doors where you would expect there to be stairs or a great hall was two giant stone spikes, they resembled claws and reached 30m from the ground to their top where they stopped just shy of the roof. Between these pillars was a mass of dizzing, swerlleling purple liquid, a purple Otto knew well, it was the same purple he saw the manastone turn back in the village hall.</p>

          <h3>Inside</h3>
          <p>Once Otto steped though the portal he could see streched out before him a long white bridge winged with more trees leading to a large palace, the door 30m tall appeared to be made of gold, with towers pointing up around the structure and beyond whos rooves where lined and eched in gold. Even the dome which sat above the maingate house appeared to be made of gold, the rooves a light blue pointed like castle from fairy tales, the walls pure white like marbel. The biggest change of all was that the rainforest was gone and replaced by towering mountins where the palace sat in the valley between.</p>
          <div class="pop">Acadamey<img class="popOut" height="400px" src="./images/academy7.jpg" alt="Acadamey"></div>

          <!-- stuff happens / sign up etc -->

          <p>Upon signing the scroll Otto felt warm and golden light bathed him. Then suddenly a message appeared infrount of his eyes. "Title: Back to School - Enter the academy, +1 Magic". Otto was elated, he had only just joined and already his magic was increaseing! Why was it called "Back to School?" if it is unlocked the first time you come? nevermind. He quickly loaded his stats.</p>

          <p>"I am use to it, all commoners are the same when they first arrive."</p>
          <p>"Oh, I, sorry."</p>
          <p>"It's fine go find your room, there should be books and uniforms inside best to learn the rules before you break them."</p>
          <p>"Yes sir, thank you" Otto bows deeply before leaving to find his room.</p>

          <!-- Arrival at the room -->

          <p>Walking away from the main hall of the academy across other bridges and though streets, markets made of students and premitted merchants. They came with wagons, small shops in the bottom floor of housing the floor was layed in marble or stone. People wore either robes, with uniform markings but of differnt colors or bright colorful casual clothing. Otto was walking for while before realising he had surely come to the end of the large academy in this direction. The stone floor had turned to a dirt track, checking a nearby stone building for its housing number and checking it to his own he walked just a little further and saw the houses of stone had become wooden, although still nice. The rooves where pointed and curved at the end and looked like how he would imagine a house from Leika would be, trees stood around and he could hear birds singing. The houses in this area where built within or near trees and nature all around, the paths where grass which had been walked more often then the other areas. Wanting to look around some more Otto climbed one of the trees and looked into the distance, the forest was large, and in the distance he could see a very large structure where there was less trees, a huge wooden palace. There where sevral buildings inside and a small wall around the outside, unable to really be able to see any details from this distance he decided to drop down and keep on looking for his assigned room.</p>

          <p>After awhile he soon found a pathed road again, but rarther then the neatly placed stones in a stright line he found randomly placed rocks between mud leading up the side of a cliff. The cliff had dewllings carved out of the rock, it was about 5 floors high. Looking back he could see ciffs on the opposing side, they had red painted pillars and a water fall falling between and atop them elven dewellings with forests around, looking between the two cliffs the opposing cliff was much more welcoming.</p>

          <p>Walking to the door carved into the cliff Otto checked the sign carved into the rock beside the door. Yup, this was the building that matched his. There where a small set of stairs leading up to a large metal door placed inside of a natural looking cave entrance. The door was so large and heavy Otto doubted he could even open, that any man could open it. So he knocked and waited.</p>

          <p>A head poped out from a floor level window. "Who is it?" a girls voice came from inside and the head looking out responded "Another of the dammed, one of us." with a big smile and the door creeked and a portion of it opned only large enough for a single body to pass though. "Welcome home brother."</p>

          <p>Walking inside the main hall was much longer ande deeper then he thought back into the cliff, a good 1km or so. Not wanting to explore around this place too much he noted that there where large stone pillers with rounded hat-like tops. Below the 'hats' where holes and inside was a glowing ball, these pillars where lining the hall all the way down lighting it. </p>

          <p>Pushing the door to his right, and looking inside was the boy from the window, two girls and another boy. Looking between them Otto decided he should introduce himself.</p>

          <p>"I am Otto I am looking for my assigned room, the start matches this buildings so I thought it was in here."</p>

          <p>Ralsan - "That'll be the case, 51? 5th floor, room 1. Ralsan is my name, this is Tisiel" A girl waved her hand, "Shrorlei Crerlass" the other girl waved quickly once with her hand, "finally we have Reingard". The final boy waved. "We are the next first years staying in this building also."</p>

          <p>Otto - "I see, why are we the 'dammed'?"</p>

          <p>Ralsan - "Ah that, to be placed all the way out here in this erm abode is because you must be poor, have no connections to anyone important and no outstanding tallent. Nothing personal just how thigh higher up's view us, not to say all the poor reside here just thoes with no history, backing, connections, long distance cousins in high places. Bascily people who cannot complain."</p>

          <p>Otto - "When passing though the military camps I had thought they placed all children of any standing in the same accomadations."</p>

          <p>Ralsan - "Well yes, but this is not a military camp, and if you take a closer look you will find they are not put into the same groups at least."</p>

          <p>Otto - "Another might be disapointed, but I look forward to being away from the noise of the town during the night at least."</p>

          <p>Ralsan - "Aha, honestly the rooms are not too bad go up and take a look, we will be here."</p>

          <p>Otto - "Ah thank you, it has been a long way."</p>

          <p>Otto headed up the stairs to the 5th floor, 1st room.</p>

          <!-- room inside -->

          <p>Inside there was a window, a desk & chair, a bed that would fit a man twice his size and a bin. Next to his feet this area was slightly lower down then the rest of the room, for about half a meter in in diamater, here was a small rack for his shoes and an old plant pot with an old umbrella inside.</p>

          <p>After removing his shoes Otto walks over to the bed where 3 uniforms are layed out on the bed, a black robe, with a smart looking pair of black trousers and t-shirt (school and class emblems etc). The next uniform was just a 2nd pair of trouers and t-shirt without any markings on. The final uniform was much softer and thinner, with a note that read "SLEEP WEAR" ontop, maybe to save a first year of the embrassment of turning up to class in pajamas.</p>

          <p>On the desk where some books, with a note that said "Read Chapter 1 of MM&M before first class." "Academy rules, regulations and assesment criteria", "Mages, Magic & Mana The basics" & "Exemplary mages: a history".</p>

          <p>Leaving his belongings and deciding not to change into his new clothes yet Otto headed back downstairs to see if he could learn more about the housing.</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "I'll show you about if you like, won't take too long not much out this way, then after why don't you go into town with me and buy me dinner as tanks" she teased with a sligh smile</p>

          <p>Otto - "Be careful what you say, I might just take you up on that."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Let's start with the tour, some of the halls are dark, but I don't bite hard."</p>

          <p>Otto - "Pfft I'll keep you at a distance then."</p>

          <p>Tisiel took him around, there were shared bath's on each floor. Students slept and cooked on floors 2 - 4. On the first floor was a libuary, it was mostly unused and dusty, the only books to be found here where either centries old or older students books left behind. Walking further down the main hall on the first floor they came to a large circular door. There where markings all around. There where 4 circles, 3 outter circles had these weird markings around them and the middle circle just had one syombol also nothing that Otto had seen before.</p>

          <p>Otto - "And this is?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Sex dungon."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Aha, you have a strange sense of humor."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Fine you got me I have no idea what this is either, truth be told not sure anyone does. No one we asked know what it is."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Bad decore"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Aha, so how about that dinner?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Sounds good to me, I have no plans to cook tonight. Know any places?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Nowhere special but just past the Leika's area is the resturants that are cloest to here, they all seem fine to me."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Lead the way, I'll pay."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ohhh have you not spent the loan yet?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Ah, I mean. It's not really my money. We were attacked on the way here."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Do Alden gods not curse thoes who take from the dead?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Can't say I know of any curses but it is not like she will need it now."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "You are going to fit in here. Ahaha."</p>

          <p>Otto and Tisiel went out for dinner in the main town, she showed him around, there was more to do closer to the academy, from pubs, sports, gambling, dueling, and many other entertainments. The noteable places around the main academy where the market areas, the main of which had a large church near by, the large arena, the academys main libuary and mission office.</p>

          <p>After dinner they made their way back to the cliffside dorm. At the entrance to the door Tisiel spoke "I am home brother."</p>
          <p>To Otto's supprise the door spoke back. "Welcome home sister."</p>
          <p>Otto - "What was that?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ah, the password. The ciffside dorm is old, no one has explained how it works only that it does."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Well it is good to know how to get in, I was worried someone would always have to be inside."</p>

          <h3>Lessons</h3>
          <h4>POV Otto Lesson on mages</h4>
          <p>"Now who can tell me what seperates a Mage does with their mana which seprates them from the Fighters?"</p>
          <p>"They project their mana into the world around them to cause change"</p>
          <p>"Good, you should all already know that having read chapter 1 of MM&M."</p>
          <p>"Todays lesson is about getting you all understanding the directions you can take as a Mage, the roles can fill in Alden and beoynd and ofcourse where to put your points."</p>

          <!-- Elements - different types of mages -->
          <!-- Jobs mages do outside of combat -->
          <!-- Combat mages, how to spend your points -->
          <p>So since we are at that time combat mages, how to spend your points. Firstly Magic also affects the total amount of MP you have, so that is usually the main stat for Mages even if you plan to be a front line fighter, healer or non-combatant.</p>

          <p>Now the other stat points there is no forumula for, so we have provided you a book containing what past mages have done and how it worked out for them you can either copy one of them or just learn from what they did and make your own path.</p>

          <p>Finally your spell points. These can be tricky you don't want to be investing all your points into an explosion style magic and then find yourself fighting with a sword, or worse, trying to farm.</p>

          <p>If there are any questions you will be seeing me once a day 4 days a week so please wait until you have read though  "Exemplary mages: a history" before asking questions as you might find your answers in there.</p>

          <p>The class shorly dismissed after, Otto went to the libuary along with many of the other students from his class and other first year classes. The main libuary was split into sections and first years who where not nobles of any kind could only access the first floor which soon became packed. Deciding he had the book he needed to read he would just go back to the cliffside.</p>

          <p>In the libuary on the cliffside Otto got to reading the historys by the light given off by the large stone pillers. After reading though so many of the Mages from the past he soon found himself bored and looking for anything else to distract him. He started looking along the spines of the old books around the libuary; 'Fire Magic', 'Faming with mana - Pocotcotcan magic', 'Lusty Ma...', 'The Summoner: Morian Zenas'. "Oh he's in the historys book, wonder if it's different".</p>
          
          <p>"I guess the people that wrote the historys just copied directly from these older books."</p>
          <p>Looking though the books again Otto finds a book half on its side, 'Otto Magnus Of Might' curious, Otto opened the book to find the pages had been cut clearnly and inside the book was a black key, and the number 34, and below it some strange makings, markings similar to the door shown to him by Tisiel. The key looked to be similar to the one to his room.</p>
          <p>This took no expert to figure out, no one had been into this libuary for a long time, the person who made that door must of lived in room 34 at sometime. If someone lives there now I will just have to be quick and use my wand of magic detection to see if there is anything there. Making his way to the room on the 3rd floor he pressed his ear up against it, no sound. Taking a deep breath Otto put the key into the door and turned it, click. He pushed the door open and sitting there looking back at him was Tisiel.</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Breaking into a ladies room without even knocking what kind of man are you?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Wait I can explain!"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "What you gonna tell me you found a book in the old libuary with strange syombols similar to the door?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yes?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ahahaha, it is my book, can't believe how quickly that worked you picked up the book with your own name on... Otto the mighty mage? really?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Hey it's not like the other mages had normal names and how did you know I would go to the old libuary and look though the books anyway?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Truthfully I didn't just took a chance to see if you where intrested in the door or knew anything about it, thats why I showed you around, no one else has taken any real intrest in it. So do you want to know whats behind the door?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Well, yeah"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Well come in, and give me my key back. There was a book in that old libuary with strange signs on like the door that I found weeks before you arrival, I managed to descifer some of it and it took me to one of the ruins just north of here, looked like an old part of the academy that had fell into disuse or something happend to it. Anyway hidden inside was this ring."</p>
          <p>Tisiel places a small dark grey ring down on the table, with the strange signs all over it glowly dimly red.</p>
          <p>Otto - "You did all that already? What does the ring do?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yes well, my specality is disyphering old texts and charms"</p>
          <p>Otto - "How do you already have a specality..."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "My parents do this sort of thing, they desypher old langauges, magic texts, relics and items. Also.. I am level 12 so I already picked my element."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Don't remeber reading about the desypher element but I am not going to lie that sounds cool"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "My element isan't called desypher, whatever I will just wait till you unlock your elements. The ring it's self though. Does nothing that I can figure out."</p>
          <p>Otto - "So when you say help, do you want me to try to and find what the ring does? help you read the text?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ah the help I need is well, do you have the skill Teather? It's just I can't learn it.."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Used all your points?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel nods in response. "But I also will need help going here" She holds out a baddly drawn map and points to a grave yard. "There is a chance we might be attacked so if I have you there... As long as I can outrun you they will be busy eating you while I get away. Deal?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "I'll learn teather, and maybe some other spells to help us KILL our opponents not run away."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I mean, as long as I get to live."</p>
          <p>Otto - "When are we going?"</p>
          <p>Titles - "I'll meet you out front in 5."</p>
          <p>Otto - "... Yeah alright."</p>

          <p>Later out infront of the cliffside.</p>
          <p class="stats">

            <li>Sense: 1</li>
            <li>Charisma: 2</li>
          </p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Whats that face?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Can't put any more points into magic. Why?</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "You can't put more points in then the level you are, points for items and your titles go ontop of that."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I see, then, I am not sure what other stats to get."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah, fighters have it easier, strength and either vitality or dexterity. For me I picked Magic and Sense, since I want to be an explorer."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Makes sense, I should pick vitality, defence, magic defence, dexterity maybe charisma...."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "You are just naming all of them."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Urgh I can't decide!"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Lets just go, you can pick on the way."</p>
          <p>Walking up north of the cliffs away from the academy the path soon becomes more dirt then stone, unused in so long. About 40 minutes later they arrive at the ruins of what could of been a small campus, it was hard to tell what it was with only the foundations of the buildings surviving.</p>
          <p>Otto - "This where you found the ring?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah, the grave yard was built outside of town though, I would of gone alone but, well you will see."</p>

          <p>Ariving before the grave yard the pair stare blankly forward. 10 meter black metal spikes raised from the ground placed close to each other too small for a person to pass though, with an eareie ghost like gas passing between the spikes.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Take it there is no gate?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Nope. This erm, wall is the problem I have."</p>
          <p>Otto - "And how will teather solve your problems?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Well, according to this book the ring has to be placed on that erm alter? inside the grave yard to prove you belong to the socity."</p>
          <p>Otto - "The alter is half a meter behind the bars, surely you can just place it on with your hand"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I mean, if you want to put your hand into and though that gas, I won't stop you."</p>
          <p>Otto - "... It's corrosive isan't it?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Very." Tisiel kicks a rock into the gas and it disappears before it can reach the otherside.</p>
          <p>Otto - "Amazing, and the ring won't disolve?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "If it does, it is the end of this mystory, but it shouldn't".</p>

          <p>With a shake of his head Otto picks up the ring from Tisiel's hand and places it on his own. He then pushed his mana though the tip of his finger and it came out like a rope. He attached the ring to the end of the rope like teather, it stuck when he willed it to grab the ring. Pushing the teathed ring into the gas he was supprised when nothing happend, pushing it past the bars and out and placeing it on the alter.</p>

          <p>Looking at each other, the bars shoot into the ground in an instant and the gas disapates. Behind is left grave stones, grass and a small stone mausoleum in the middle.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Ladies first."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Get moving you coward."</p>

          <p>Otto - "No zombies, supprising."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Don't jinx it."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Grab the ring?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "On the way out, same method or we die."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Glad I asked..."</p>

          <p>Opening the door and looking around inside, the pair see nothing, it's dark so they case mage light, mana gathers in the palm of their hands and gives off a small blue glow.</p>

          <p>Otto - "This is the light from the cliffside."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah I mean, it's a common and useful spell."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Ah"</p>
          <p>Inside was three stone boxes, the length and width of a man. On top of each of the boxes carved from stone was the sculpture of two woman and a man.</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Sarcophagus, Alden nobels are burried like this even today."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I did not know that. Our dead are burried in the village."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "We burn ours. Since you took money from a dead girl before, guess you won't mind breaking open some ones resting place?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "I don't mind, but you make me sound like a bad guy..."</p>
          <p>Tisiel just smiled as she crouched down opened the book and started reading and marking her fingers along the signs on the stone.</p>
          <p>Pushing the stone lids to one side in the first Otto found a skeleton of a woman, proberly the woman who was carved ontop. Prying the rings from her fingers and the necklase from her finally he took the tiara from her head. Tisiel looked up at him as he removed items from a grave with a strange look.</p>
          <p>Otto - "I remember this being your idea, you might need them"</p>
          <p>Tisiel just rolled her eyes and went back to studying the signs around the sarcophaguses. In the second was the skeleton of a man, a wand, crown and one ring. The third contained another woman, jewlery and one coin. Making small pile of loot on the ground Otto turned to Tisiel.</p>
          <p>Otto - "Learn anything?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I will have to keep coming here to read these, but the words I think I understand, he is a king, she was a queen and the secound woman was his daughter."</p>
          <p>Otto - "They died at the same time?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "No real evenidence of that. Let's see what you found."</p>
          <p>Tisiel looked though the items before deciding she had no idea which where important and which where not.</p>
          <p>Otto - "Look away for a moment."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Why?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Secret."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Fine, but no funny stuff."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Like I would..."</p>
          <p>Otto took out his wand and passed mana though it before placeing it back, he then moved the crown, wand and the kings ring to one side. The Queens tiara & ring. The daughters coin. "You can look again"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I had to wait for you to make two piles?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "The ones in this pile contain magic, these don't"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I won't ask how but it would be amazing if they still cotain magic, It must of been centries since anyone came here. Let's get them all back I can use my skills to desypher these items and tell you what they all do."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Sure, let's put them in your bag, keep them safe."</p>

          <p>When the pair step outside the mausoleum some of the stone stachues carved on the graves or around the mausoleum fell appart. One manages to maintain some of its form and runs towards Otto and Tisiel who split and run, seeing the stone figure of a warrior from an age Otto did not know was running after Tisiel.</p>

          <p>Running up to the golem Otto cast 'Strike' and the weak statue became enraged but the mana that stuck down from above him had almost tore his arm off. "Tisiel, Stike it." Tisiel turned and thew a ball of mana into it. One arm breaks off and Otto seeing manaball can be used as a weapon joins in and creates a ball of mana in the palm of his hand and slams it into the statue. Under the bombardment soon the statue fell appart with a creepy cry of anguish. </p>

          <p>Otto - "They must of all been guardians, for them to be so weak. Some of them even broke appart when activated."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "More impressive that they even activated, but that could help us determin the age of this place."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Been meaning to ask, if it has been here so long, don't you think someone else would of opened the door by now, or know what it was or what this graveyard is?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "It's possible, but the fun is in the discovery. Now get the ring with theather and let's leave before something else comes to life."</p>

          <p>Tisiel praticly locked herself in her room for a few days, only coming out to go to lessons and eat. Otto went to check on here everyday, it was amazing at the speed she desyphered at considering she had to make time for her normal studies.</p>

          <p>Teacher - "Todays lesson will be on comabt between mages, and a little on combat between mages and other classes. The upcoming duels have some of you excited, and this lesson is to help you prepare for the battle ahead. Now in real duels you will be premitted to use your own equipment but for this session you can only use the weapons provided to you, and the uniform you are wearing now. You may not enchant or enhance any of the equipment."</p>

          <p><li>Body:<font color="darkgrey">  Academy Robe (black).</font> Magic: +1, Health + 10.</li></p>

          <p>"Now the most obvious thing when thinking about duels between mages is that they use magical attacks. Convention gives that should you be up against a mage Magic Defence is the best option to counter that as it reduces the damage by more vitality increases your health. However you must consider the bigger picture, once you leave the academy not all of your oppoents will be mages and some will use physical attacks and the points you put into Magic Defence will do nothing to protect from that.</p>

          <p>"The secound thing to think about during a duel although not as relivent during your lower levels is the amount of mana you and your oppoent have. If you run out of mana it is likely you will passout early on and be unable to fight."</p>

          <p>"Finally is the element type. You might be an amazing fire-mage but if your opponet is using water, you are at a huge disadvantage so keep that in mind. If there are no further questions about the duels we will move onto charms and how to counter them."</p>

          <p>The lesson continued as normal, reading though past mages, their feats and discoveries.</p>

          <p>Looking though the list of skills a lighting mage could learn Otto could not really decide which he wanted and which he should avoid. He narrowed it down to just a few he felt like he could use:</p>

          <p> 
            Chain Lightning,
            Dazing Bolt,
            Thunderstorm,
            Shocking Touch,
            Sparks,
            Lightning Bolt,
            Lightning Rune,
            Lightning Cloak,
            Thunderbolt,
            Static Field,
            Wall of lightning,
            Lightning Storm,
            Discharge,
            Charged Charge.
         </p>

         <p>He decided to pick up, lightning cloak, shocking touch, chain lighting, charged charge and wall of lightning.</p>

         <p>Thinking on what the teacher had said, mages in the duels would be using magic attacks so it is potent to put points into magic defence. But Otto wanted to think about the future also, no not putting points into defence but strength. There was nothing in the rules to say he had to use magic, and his element lightning would travel easier though a metal blade then a wooden wand.</p>

         <p>His hp at the moment was 210. The largest attack a level 10 student using a non elemental attack would be stike with no element would be about 100. Hoping even with the element added maybe he could take two hits. His plan would fall appart if the hit was a critical however.</p>

         <!-- level *5 magic * 8 = mp // level * 10 vit * 14. +100 = hp -->
         <p>Otto had made his preperations and headed to the arena where the duels would be held this week. Thoes not dueling would have to take notes and give feedback to thoes who where dueling.</p>

         <p>Otto would be dueling on days 3 and 5. He spent the first day watching his class mates duel, most of the matches ended quite quickly with the students hp being reduced in 1 to 5 hits. There was ofcouse the odd duel where two defensive type mages met and each would exchange blows of around 5% of their total hp and mana comsumption became important.</p>

         <p>Knowing his duels would not become a slogging match between two defensive mages Otto tried to concentrate on the matches between two offensive mages, or how to break though the defence of a defensive mage. What became very clear was that mages at this level where slow, not very powerful and had defences like paper.</p>

         <p>On the secound day he managed to catch that some of his house mates where signed up also and went to see their matches. Tisiel's match ended in her loss, she only signed up for the expereince and would never be a dedicated combat mage. Shrorlei's match was a weird one, with some of her spells not activating and her oppoents sometimes fizziling out, the teachers reacted with no shock at all like it was expected but some of the students, like Otto could not understand. Reingard overwheled his oppoennt with a constant stream of manaballs but soon ran out of mana and passed out, he had won the match however. Ralsan did not fight today and Otto had missed his first match yestoday.</p>

         <p>On the third day Otto equiped his formal outfit, mages robe and headed down to the area again. This time however instead of watching the matches he made his way into the armory beneath the area. Inside where many students picking out weapons and signing in that they where present. Otto signed next to his name picked up a completly metal spear and sat down to wait. He got a few weird looks, some of the students even pittied him thinking he must of thought the metal spear was some kind of magic staff, but non of them thought to correct him.</p>

         <p>Soon enough Otto's name was called, along with another boys Daniel. He was tall, a little chubby, with hair so short you could see his scalp like it had recently been shaved off and grown back. He had a friendly face however, squinting eyes that looked like they where smileing. He had a 20cm wand in his hand made of wood, the wood was much darker then the wand Otto had in his room. Thinking there is not much to learn from his oppnent and he would just stick to his plan he greeted Daniel wiht a smile and a bow. Daniel bowed back and the pair made their way into the area.</p>

         <p>It was hot, too hot. The moment they steped out Otto could feel his face starting to sweat, the crowd where shouting on their friends and now being down in the middle of it all he could hear just how loud the curved walls of the area made the crowd. Otto opend with castin lightning cloak, lightning covered his entire robe but would only react on contact so it was of no threat to Daniel with that the match began. Daniel opened with a manaball which gathered in the palm of his hand and looked to be made of mud and earth, before he had much time to debate Daniel's element it was flug towards him at great speed. Casting wall of lightning infrount of him, lightning bolts stuck up from the ground 1m in height. Otto ducked and the ball his the lighting bolts and broke appart, the pieces of the ball exploded out in all directions some of them hitting into Ottos arm and  side. He had lost alot of mana and some hp in that exchange and Daniel had come out ontop. Gripping his spear and casting Charged Charge his body felt lighting crawling all over his skin his muscles twitched from the stimulus and he shot foward and great speed. Daniel taken back by this sudden change summoned an earthen 1m wall infrount of himself, which Otto just jumped over easily with his increased speed. He lunged the spear into Daniel's center and cast Shocking touch, the spell worked by releasing lighting-mana from his fingers but as he had hoped the lighting ran the length of the spear and entered Daniel's body. The last thing Otto remebered was the great pain in his feet and legs as a 1m earthen spike shot out of the ground and sent him flying. The match was over.</p>

         <p>Waking in a bed unfamilia to him with bright white light shining into his eyes, Otto reached his hand to cover his face from the brightness and looked around. In a bed to the right of him sitting up eating red grapes was Daniel. Turning towards Otto and smiling.</p>

         <p>Daniel - "Congradulations on your win, I'm Daniel the first earth mage to lose to a lightning mage this year."</p>

         <p>Feeling awkuard Otto responded "Sorry about that, but how is it my win if I ended up in here also?"</p>
         
         <p>Daniel - "First to bring the oppoents health to 10 points wins, after you lowered my health to 10 points so the spell that activated after although lowering your health to 10 points also means I came secound."</p>

         <p>Otto - "Oh I see, sorry again. Can I ask, why does our health stop at 10 points?"</p>

         <p>Daniel - "Don't be sorry your prize is to do that again, you where my final match and I don't plan on going though that pain again any time soon. You don't know? Teacher should of told you, during a duel your health stops at 10 points so no one dies. If you want to know more then that you'll have to ask professor Farald he's an expert on it."</p>

         <p>Otto - "Thank you, I think I must of missed when we were taught that. How did your first match go?"</p>

         <p>Daniel - "Easy win, guess that's why I was so confident going in. This will teach me."</p>

         <p>Otto soon left the infimary and went back to his room to rest after being granted leave for the afternoon. The show he put on today proberly caught some attention using a spear to get shocking touch's range to increase. Any mage in the know however would of noticed that shocking touch alone would never of K.O. Daniel in one hit but all he could do was hope non of the students worked out his plan. Trying to formulate a new plan Otto went top side, on the top of the cliff was an area set out for training, or at least that what it had become. Otto was trying to push his lighting-mana into the spear and throw it, the only trouble was, the lighting-mana he wrapped around the spear didn't travel with the spear, the spear flew and the lighting mana just disipated. "There must of been a skill for this I don't have yet or missed.. I am out of spell points anyway."</p>

         <p>Ralsan - "If you have a spare spell point and force it enough you can learn a skill that way. Would look cool to see a lighting spear."</p>

         <p>Otto - "Hey, yeah it would of but I don't have any skill points left."</p>

         <p>Ralsan - "Please tell me you at least got discharge?"</p>

         <p>Otto - "No, I thought since it drains so much mana I would just pass out, so I didn't get it."</p>

         <p>Ralsan - "From what I saw you passed out anyway. I just came up to tell you its dinner, we are eating togeather while we give each other advice."</p>

         <p>Otto - "Ah, i'll be down shortly, thank you."</p>

<h4>The fifth day.</h4>
<p>Otto again entered the armory and debated on which weapon to pick, this time the other students in the armoy where curious about what he would do. Trying to ignore their stares by telling himself this is just 5 minutes of fame they will all forget about me soon enough. Otto picked up a warhammer, the thing was easily 30kg, no mage in the right mind would use such a weapon, no normal mage could even wield such a thing. Smiling to himself internally with and idea of how to act in this battle Otto took his place and waited.</p>

<p>"Otto & Kaja make your war to the arena."</p>

<p>Kajs was a little shorter then Otto, dark blonde hair and dark blue eyes, but the most noticable thing about her was a large wooden sheild in her left hand.</p>

<p>Otto - "How did you know you would be fighting me?"</p>

<p>Kaja - "I didn't just figured some other punk would try it, if I don't need it I can drop it if I do need I got it. Although that is not a spear." she pointed to the warhammer balanced on Otto's sholder.</p>

<p>Otto - "No, no it is not" he replied with a smile.</p>

<p>They made their way into the arena, bowed to each other and the match started. Kaja kept her wand hidden behind the shield and when she casted fireballs she moved the shield and released them at Otto who was trying his best to avoid them enterely. Taunting him as he danced. "You'll have to fight back pretty boy or I'll burn your hair off."</p>

<p>"Stop shotting me and I might" Otto relied moving aside of yet antoher fireball, while he was saving mana his stamnia would not last much longer he would start to become slow. Using Charged charge Otto dashed across the field and slamed his warhammer into Kaja's sheild, although it helped she struggled under the force and fell down. The shield had reduced the attack from 72% of her hp to just damaging 34%, it would take 3 attacks to take her down instead of 2. While down but not out, Kaja shot a fireball into Ottos stomach. -25% health. Good thing she keeps using fireball and nothing else, Otto moved to swing his warhammer again, this time without charged charge he resorted to using shocking touch but he only managed 28% of her health. Kaja struck back with a flamethrower spell putting Ottos clothes on fire, dropping and rolling away Otto lost his warhammer on the ground to put out the fire, -25% again.</p>

<p>Kaja - "What will you do now, without your toy? Time to become ash and smoke." Kaja raised her wand and the ground started to burn, Ottos feet strated to sweat, she was going to set him on fire from below this time. Too far away to hit her with anything useful all my spells only have 1m range. Chainlightning. Otto stuck the warhammer with chainlightning, the lightning hit the warhammer and bounced into Kaja -14%, the sudden shock and pain caused her to lose concentration and Otto took his chance and dashed for her.</p>

<p>Grabbing the warhammer he felt a sudden burning sessions in his side, -28%. She hit me with another one of thoes damnned fireballs. Screaming as he turned to use charged charge he accelerated, Kaja seeing this coming enveloped herself in fire-mana as he slamed his warhammer down into her shield, the fire mana had increased her defences 22% dammage. Thinking to himself if she was level 14 or less she would be dead. -35%. The fire cloak had stuck him as he came into melee rang, His health had reached the final 10 first, his blow had landed moments after leaving her with 2% hp. He had lost.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the battle, she must of been at least level 15, would of put her hp at 250 unless she put any points into vitality in which case she might be a lower level. Unable to do anything about it now the reflection was a form of self improvement rarther then an excuse for his loss, he would reflect on what happend, what he should of done and grow from this.</p>

<p>Bowing to Kaja, and her to him they left the arena and returned their weapons, it was nice to not have been knocked out this time. walking back to watch the rest of the duels though the day he got an unexpected visit from his teacher.</p>

<p>Lubin - "Rarther intresting approach, Strength in a match between mages."</p>

<p>Otto - "Did not think that would slip by you, do you disapprove?"</p>

<p>Lubin - "No not really, I trust you have read though the historys at least once? You are not the first mage to try strength and magic. I'm sure you won't be the last but it is very uncommon during peace times."</p>

<p>Otto - "Why is it uncommon during times of peace?"</p>

<p>Lubin - "The method of strength and magic is one usually only taken after level 50, to do it so early would only happen when you have many types of enimies, a hard road before level 50 mind you. I just came to give some advice, Historys: Battle-mages, Fighter-Mage, Inquisitor, Mage-Tanks are all a good place to start. There are more however, slightly more unsual methods, in the main libuary there is also records from a necomancer and a deathknight. Not usually given out to first year students, but usual first year students dont put points into strength."</p>

<p>Otto - "Thank you sir, but why would you go out of your way to do all this forme?"</p>

<p>Lubin - "Nothing personal, it's just my job, guide students to a path that they want to take, once they find their path help them traverse it. Don't mitsake this for me picking favrouts I am just doing what is expected of me. You may take your leave for the day if you want, I believe you have some reading to do."</p>

<p>Otto - "Yes sir, thank you sir" And with that Otto went to the libuary while the other first year students where in the arena to read up on the necromancer and the deathknight. </p>

          <!-- Arena --> 

          <!-- Tisiel's door -->

          <p>Having gotten Tisiel's letter Otto was standing infrount of the giant circular door waiting for her. Tisiel soon arrived looking like she had stayed up all night again.</p>
          <p>Otto - "So you made a big break though?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yes, I am sure we can open this door"</p>
          <p>Otto - "How?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "You just have to take this ring, get down on one knee and ask me to marry you. Simple right?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "The door shall forever remain a mystory, no one will ever know what was behind it. Shame really."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - puffing out her cheeks "It was just a joke, but seriosuly though we can open the door, we just have to read this passage togeather outloud and combine the wand with the ring."</p>
          <p>Otto  - "Alright let's get this over with, these better not be wedding vows."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "It was a joke.."</p>

          <p>Togeather the pair read off a translated version of the passage from the book, the sounds dont fit quite togeather as they should but still the doors syombols glow red like the ring. As instructed Otto places the wand though the ring Tisiel is holding and they both pass mana though, sure enogh the circles begang to rotate. Soon the door seem to disappear like it was never there, confused the pair just look at each other.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Hold up, I had to put my wand in your ring? I bet this is a sex dungon after all."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ohh, how about a wager. If its a sex dungon I will buy you dinner. If not, you buy you dinner."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Aha you are on, now get your ass in the creepy sex dungon."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Good thing no one else is around.."</p>

          <p>Stepping inside they find stairs leading down into darkness, lighting up mana balls to float around them they make their way down to the bottom. At the bottom was a small dark room, it contained a desk book shelves and a chest of draws. There were lots of books, a large blue orb giving off a little light and skulls. Many, many skulls, they lined the book shelves with books leaning against them, they where a few on the desk, the draws in the chess where full of skulls.</p>

          <div class="pop">Room<img class="popOut" src="./images/wizroom.jpg" height="400px" alt="Room"></div>

          <p>Otto - "You owe me dinner."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - ".. This is NOT a sex dungon!"</p>
          <p>Otto - "I dunno, mood lighting, sexy skulls"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Phahaha, you freak get looking for loot."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yeah alright"</p>

          <p>While Tisiel was looking though the books Otto whiped out his wand and looked for magic items. Most of the objects in the room remaind as they where, except from the orb the only items in the room which glowed where the qill left on the table, a wizards hat screwed up in a corner, a pendent ontop of the chess of draws and one of the skulls on the book shelf. Taking these items and placing them on the desk togeather when Tisiel had finished looking though the books and taking the ones she likes in a small pile on the desk they decided to go though what they had found.</p>

          <p>Otto - "Think you can work out what these items do?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Well yeah, given time I am sure I can do a few of them, lets take these things out of here and back to my room we can go over what we have."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yeah I don't want to spend too long down here."</p>

          <p>Otto - "lets go over what we have, and how do we split it up?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ah, this is where I betray you, and steal all the loot for myself. Using the ill gotten goods I get propelled forward and become a huge master of the realm"</p>
          <p>Otto - "What are the chances that any of this stuff is even useful to you? And like you'd betray me, you'd have no one to join you in your sex dungon then."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "IT IS NOT A SEX DUNGON! .... I am not sure what it is yet, looked like a study, private place to work, but why? I am sure I will get to the bottom of though though my studies. Anyway at this level it's less about finding something helpbut but building myself around what we have found."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I am sure you will find out what was going on down there and drag me back in soon, honestly if you really wanted the items I would rarther have a trust worthy partner then one or two magic items I am not sure I can even use."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ohh, you trust me? That's new. I'll tell you what they do, well what I know then we take turns taking one each?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Mmm that's more then fair, honestly we the exams coming up and arena matches and a long life ahead of us I hope we do find time to work togeather again, this has been a good friendship"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ahhh stop talking you're making things awkuard."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Starting with the wand and ring that opened the door. I am unsure what else they can do but they seem to be syombols of the people that made the door, graveyard and lived in the ruined academy. I'd like to keep studying them..."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Taking two already? It's fine, we might need them in the future I won't give you a hard time you can keep them without it counting as one of yours."</p>
          <p>Tisiel nod's and continues - "Now the Kings crown. It's the Crown of the Dammed. A rare piece, increases your magic and decreases your charisma, aswell as increasing the number of undead you can control."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Creepy."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yes well, perfect for a necromancer or a mage who just does not care for their appearance and others."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Ah, so it's perfect for you?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Tsst, I acctually do want it, it is intresting but I do care how I look thank you very much."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Mmm sorry that was too far, I think you and Reingard will make a beautiful couple."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I.. What? Why do you say that!?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Knew it. Now keep going before he gets the wrong idea about why I keep coming into your room alone with you."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Tsst, you. The kings ring, is an basic undead control ring increaseing your control over the undead."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yours."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Thank you. The queens tiara, it's called Queen's pawn, it comes with the skill animate stone. That explains the things that attacked us in the grave yard."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Her ring, it gives a little strength to the wearer."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Finally the daughters coin, who though more research I am not sure is there daughter at all. I am not even sure if they are related and this coin is a mystory to me, can't find any references to coins like it, and I cannot tell what kind of magic it cointains."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Hmmm kind of junky items then? The tiara sounds expensive maybe it would be better to sell it?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah I don't feel like you are wrong, its so niche. It's not like we have a stone mason to make use humanoid statue's. Anyway the stuff from the room. The pendent increase your magic much more then normal items but reduces your strength it's really popular amoung mages if you take it with the queens ring there will be no negative effects, can't have you been to small."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Aha, I'll take them even if you are trying to get rid of that ring."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Hehe you saw though that. Next is the skull-"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yours."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "It might be amazing."</p>
          <p>Otto - "... No one is going to talk to me if I walk around with a skull."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Why do you care if people talk to you?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Do you want the skull or not?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Fine, I wanted it anyway. Now the Hat increases your magic. It's acctually pretty good."</p>
          <p>Otto - "And the quill?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Come on you don't want the quill."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yeah, I want the hat but what does the quill do."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ah, it helps your chances when eteching encantments on items"</p>
          <p>Otto - "I get the feeling you came out of this better then me"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "There is still the coin and tiara."</p>
          <p>Otto - "I'll take the coin, you can sell the tiara and buy me dinner, I'm sure I was right about that sex dungon."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I will stab you to death with this quill if you menction that again."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Hehe, fine let's go eat. I would like to know what was going on down there though."</p>

          
          <h4>Dinner</h4>

          <p>Otto - "Tisiel it had sliped my mind, but I took notes on the history of these two mages from the main libuary, I think you might find them more useful then me reflecting on whats happened."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "On whats happened?" Looking at the titles and quickly skimming the contense of the book. "You know, you might be right, this looks exsactly like the kind of inspireation I need for myself, mind if I copy this?"</p>

          <p>Otto - "Go ahead, but don't summon skeletons and leave them in my room."</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Ah that was my whole plan!"</p>

          <h3>Missions</h3>
          <h4>Sign up</h4>
          <p>It was finally mission day, after so long of waiting first years where finally in a posistion to leave the safety of the academy and go into the world, both inside of the academy grounds which seem vast with many areas totally unexplored and the world beyond the portal. It was also a good way to make money.</p>

          <p>The missions where not the adventure thill ride Otto had expected, one of the mission slips said "Lightning mage wanted: To put manaballs around bathhouse to keep mosquitoes away." He had ended up taking this one, he had no idea what mosquitoes where but at least he would be helping someone. Tisiel's mission of going though old junk and decrypting them seemed to suit her, Reingard had even joined her as a bodyguard. Otto left though the portal back to Banderdam, this mission would take him though Chihal and down to Savigal a port town on the border with Huonhia. Since his ID now had him marked as a combat mage he was able to join a merchant group heading to Chihal.</p>

          <p>Sitting in the back of a wagon the trip was mostly uneventful, Chihal sat between 3 ports so natureally had a large market place. There were no walls, no castle and seemed very peaceful, it was far from any border conflict with the monsters down south even if Huonhia ever tried to invade it was unlikly they would push this far to assult Chihal it could not serve any strategic importance. The town it's self was rarther small, there were few farms outside tended by mages who had retired from the academy and inside the town was a few dwellings, tavern, inn and the market place. It took 9 hours to arrive they had stopped for lunch but the time was still very good. It would take a further 6 hours at least to reach Savigal so Otto decided to book a room at the inn then have a look around the market place.</p>

          <!-- Inn -->

          <!-- Market place with strange goods. -->
          <p>The market place was selling all kind of oddities with merchants traveling between ports and cities stopping off here they opened shop from their wagons, wands, weapons, armor, skeletons, mana stone, mounts, there was even one merchant selling long metal tubes with a wooden handle, he claimed they where wands of explosion magic but said he had no idea how they worked.</p>
          <!-- journey -->
          <p>Setting off from Chihal the weather was colder then it was yestoday. Without the wagon to sit in today would leave him tired. Wrapping the robe around himself to keep the wind off he walked along the path with the rainforest on either side. There were a few others travling also but most of the merchants and others where heading to Banderdam or the two larger ports in the area. Savigal would be a small port it seems. After walking for 3 hours Otto needed to pee, walking into the rainforest just off the path to do it in peace.</p>
          <!-- The dead forigner -->
          <p>While relaving himself he soon noticed hanging above him from the tree was a deadman. Pulling his robe back around himself and grabbing his warhammer Otto span around looking about. Nothing. Closer inspection would show he had been dead awhile, his flesh was mostly gone, the eyes removed it seemed the animals had long been at his body, the smell was bad but thats not what had Otto's attention. Tangled in the vines the man was wearing strange clothes, even strange for a nobel, a blue jacket with gold trim, but it had no hood and didnt feel like a woolen robe. The cuffs and sholders where not sewn into the sleaves but rarther left to hand over the top. The mans face was strange too, but hard to judge a man whos been picked at by the birds. Looking down on the ground some of the mans belongings where here, strange purple coins, a wand, looked like the merchants explosion wands back in Chihal, if it was though it was faulty as no explosion had happend around here. There where papers and food. Otto decided to move the items into his bag as the mans bag was torn.</p>

          <p>"I'll take them back to the academy with me maybe Tisiel can make sense of these things." setting back on the path to Savigal Otto made his way for another hour before coming across another body, a merchant he had seen earlier that day. This body was fresh, still bleeding out but long dead. He was not a well to do merchant, he had no wagon or body guards but was travling with others. Seems they had no robbed him as his trinkets and food lay scattered about the path and into the forest.</p>
        <!-- Danger -->

        <p>Getting closer to the body Otto could see the dead body of a large wolf in the direction the blood went into the forest, the wolf was almost 2 meters tall when stood on all fours and over 3 meters long. The problem was there was only one wolf body, even Otto knew wolves don't attack alone normally. The other merchants where no where to be seen, prehaps the pack is still chasing them? They might double back for the kill they got, I should get away from here.</p>

        <p>I left at a brisk pace down the road, since the merchants didn't come back towards me I must assume they made their way down here so I should keep a look out. Soon enough I came across the other merchants, arranged around the wagon with small gaps in their line. Unable to see into the forest the only monsters I could make out where two large wolves similar size to the one back with the dead merchant and one smaller about half their size cloestest to my position. Unsure of what to do for awhile I just stayed still, soon enough a large man in the group shouted towards me. "If you stand alone they will target you and take you out, run quick and get into the group." at his shout I ran, I ran as fast as I could, not having invested many points into dexterity it was not easy as I used the strength I had invested into my stats to pump my legs as hard as I could. Soon enough the wolves noticed me, the small one charged towards me as the merchant's and body guards intercepted the larger wolves taking this oppertunity to attack them. Seeing the wolf run towards me with its fangs out scared me. I gripped tight around the warhammer and launched byself with Charged Charge, my legs twitched with lighting, my speed shot up over that 1 meter gap. Launching myself warhammer first into the beast it hit the ground with a whimper, blood and fangs splattered over the floor. The hammer has caused more damage then the lighting. A normal baby wolf would of had it's whole head caved in, my attack did 72%. The large man who had called me over stabbed a spear into the wolf as it tried to get back up. It would never get back up.</p>
        
        <p>He ran to help with the two larger wolves, I tried to stike one of them with a lightning strike, 0.05% damage. One of the largers wolves was slayn the other ran bleeding back into the forest. I was later told by Giselher the large body guard who speared the smaller wolf that the large wolves where between level 20 and 29. They had high magic defences and often made pray of magical or weak humans. I don't know what the large wolf dropped by the small wolf dropped a pair of gloves, Giselher gave them to me saying I did most of the damage anyway and he was supprised a mage would have so much strength. I gladdly accepted it would be my first monster drop. To get to Savigal I decided to join their group just encase the last wolf made a return.</p>

        <li>Hands:<font color="darkgrey">Mutt's Mits</font> Magic defence +1.</li>

        <h4>Savigal</h4>
        <p>Savigal port was so small it did not even have a market worth a menction, just ships and merchants setting up on wooden crates or out the back of the wagons, no real stalls. The port had 2 ships in dock, a small cog with one sail. The other was a Hatalia ship, a balinger with a single mast with many holes for oars although they where closed right now, I could only tell it was from Hatalia because of the flag flown from the rear of the ship, it was unlikely they built the ship themselves, Hatalia's navy might be as large as Aldens but they where a much larger country. Hatalian's broguht their ships from Chalbia.</p>

        <p>I made my way though the small market place buying fruits and rations for the trip back, I could make the trip in 2 days and rest at a town each night so I did not need much, but when travling and with the funds to do so it' nice to try new things. After shopping I went to the office building, normally a small town like this would use the village hall for any government administation, but since Savigal was a port town capable of being used during times of war it had a government office building here. All I had to do was take my ID and mission slip in and in return they informed the bathhouse. While I waited for the sun go to down since the mission was to take place just after the sun sets I rested in the rarther large taven.</p>

        <h4>The bath houses</h4>
          <p>Just after the sun set I made my way to the bath house, waiting for me was an elderly woman, haunched over a small cane in her hand she smiled and waved towards me. I waved back, my robe must of given me away.</p>

          <p>"Must be the boy they sent from the academy, first year am I right?"</p>

          <p>"Yes but how did you know?"</p>

          <p>"You robe, pure black. They will give you a new one when you get back, thing is it embrasses the academy if a mage with colors dies on their first mission."</p>

          <p>"Oh I see.."</p>

          <p>"Don't worry the only danger to your mission is making it all the way out here, the task of putting up mana-balls should be simple really. Follow me I just need you to put lightning-mana balls inside these stone totems. Should keep thoes damnned things away. What you doing back there don't be shy the bathhouse is empty tonight."</p>

          <p>"Ah yes sorry, the sign said ladies so.."</p>

          <p>"It's empty get in here."</p>

          <p>"Yes Ma`am."</p>

          <p>The mission was really short, after putting a few lighting mana balls and chatting to the bathhouse lady for awhile I found out the mana-balls had gone out because the mana stones keeping them active had run out. I also learned mosquitoes are small bugs that bite you, and it is really itchy! The cure however is a 40 degree bath ... This has to be the best perk of the job.</p>

          <p>While relaxing in the bath, I could feel the warmth move into my toes, it felt like the warmth was moving into my bones, my muscles relaxed and time just seem to pass by...</p>

          <p>"AHHHHHHHHH"</p>

          <p>"Huh?" I jumped up and grabbed for my warhammer, the cold soon gripped by body after leaving the warm waters. As I looked towards the scream I noticed it was a girl wrapped in a towel, soon her mother came to her and I remebered I was naked.</p>

          <p>"Ah you're still in here? I didn't think you'd still be in here oh deary me put a towel around yourself gave the girl a fight" the bathouse woman seemed to be enjoying the mischief she had made. Is she so bored as to set me up like this!?</p>

          <p>After appologising to the girl and her mother and the many other women on the way out I made my way over to the tarvern. Tonight I would drown that embrassment in drink.</p>
          
        <h4>side quest</h4>
        <p>Just as I was getting my first drink the bar tender handed me a note, on the front was my name in scribbled hand writing. Inside was a baddly drawn map with a line from the tavern into the nearby forest with a large X on it. "What the hell is this?" I asked no one inparticular.</p>

        <p>"Can't say I understand it, but looked like a map to me."</p>

        <p>"Mmm yeah thanks, who gave it to you?"</p>

        <p>"Bathous.."</p>

        <p>"Yeah I'm not going."</p>

        <p>"Isan't she your employeer?"</p>

        <p>"...It's almost like you don't want my money.. Fine I'm going.."</p>

        <p>"Take care of yourself, no doubt she's up to no good."</p>

        <p>"...Yeah"</p>

        <p>Making my way back into the village, past the bathhouse and up into the forest, not too far into the forest was a small house, walking up the stairs and knocking on the small door I wanted, soon enough the bathouse women opned the door. "Ah good you got my message"</p>

        <p>"Bearly it looked like a childs drawing."</p>

        <p>"Well it is, Mia here drew it."</p>

        <p>It was the girl from the bathouse, I could not be more embrassed. "Ah sorry about earlier." I touched the back of my head and tried to smile. Mia just looked away with a red face, seems she dose not like me. I wouldn't like me either..</p>

        <p>"So, why did you call me out here?"</p>

        <p>"Ah well I know it's not part of the request I sent to the academy, but would you light a mana-ball here also? Just to help out an old women, no one wants to be bitten by thoes nasty thing."</p>

        <p>"Yeah alright." I lit up the stone totem from the inside.</p>

        <p>"Mia is my grandaughter. Not that you asked, but she is a Mage and is going to the academy next year."</p>

        <p>"I'm sure she will enjoy it there and learn much, just write ahead in advance and ask not to be put into the cliffside."</p>

        <p>"Well ofcouse everyone knows that."</p>

        <p>My eyebrow twitched at the comment..</p>

        <p>"What I really was hoping was that you could talk to Mia and tell her about the academy it's been so long since I went I am sure it is nothing like it was before."</p>

        <p>"Ah okay, I guess I can, as a way to say sorry..."</p>

        <p>"That's the spirit, I'll get you two some drinks and food, I hope you like mangos."</p>

        <p>This is going to be so awkuard. In the end Mia was easy to talk to, since we were almost the same age and I had only just joined the academy and she was so intrested in it we had alot to talk about. I ended up sleeping there after Mia went home, at least I saved the cost of a room, I would head back early in the morning and try to make it to Chihal and look around the market by the afternoon.</p>

          <h3>Meet Tsuma as witch princess from Leikia.</h3>
          <p>Otto could not help but stop listining to the coversation, his eyes had been caught and his full attention was now directly focused the woman who had just walked though the door.
