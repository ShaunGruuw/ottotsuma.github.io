<!-- Classes, normal (blue), rare (green), epic (red), Unique (purple), legendary (Orange), growth-type (Seraph(pink)), Quest/inherent (gold). 

	(basic classes are the options given when you start, does not have to always be normal type class. Advanced classes are just classes beyound the basic classes, can also be normal type.)

Items follow a smililar logic

Races follow no such pattern. Each as benifits and disadvantages of it`s own. 

Spells/Skills are on a spheregrid alongside attribute nodes (stat change nodes). They are often blocked (greyed out) until a certen level or criteria is met. Once unlocked a player can dump level points into the node until full. So at level 30 Spells/Skills beyond the basic`s are unlocked up to a cap of 3, So a player can only put a maximum of 3 points into a spell (unless otherwise stated). This happens again at level 80 the cap is raised to 6 and players can now improve the potency/cast time/range/area/etc. Of each of their unlocked skills.

										<ul> 
											<li>Asari - Increased sucess with mind related spells on opposite gender</li>
											<li>Gnoll - Can gain access to spells early from their Demon Lord</li>
											<li>Vampire - Blood magic is always unlocked</li>

									<h2>Elements</h2>
									 </header>
									<p>To start all mages get access to mana-spells, these are non-elemental versions of starting spells (mana-ball, tether etc.) Once an element is chosen you can still use the non-elemental spells (many players like to use mana-ball as a light source). Each element has it`s own charteristic</p>
								
								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">
										<span class="icon solid fa-code-branch"></span>
										<strong>Fire</strong> Fire spells mostly have a chance to apply a Burn DoT, also gives off light
									</li>
									<li class="style2">
										<span class="icon fa-folder-open"></span>
										<strong>Electric</strong> Electric spells often have a Mana Drain affect & somtimes a chance to cause paralasis but cost more mana
									</li>
									<li class="style3">
										<span class="icon solid fa-signal"></span>
										<strong>Wind</strong> Wind spells often have a speed change affect, often cost less mana and are easier to deploy over a wide area
									</li>
									<li class="style4">
										<span class="icon solid fa-laptop"></span>
										<strong>Earth</strong> Earth spells are often easiest to deploy over a wide area, cost effective while using the terrain but hard to control 
									</li>
									<li class="style5">
										<span class="icon fa-gem"></span>
										<strong>Water </strong> Water spells have a chance to apply "wet" status effect, harder to deploy over a wide area, can make use of terrain to lower casting cost
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="content">These are just the starting elements the advance classes & the 2nd element choice have a wider range of elements to pick from. Gaining access to a 2nd element allows you to combine the spells for a new effect.</p>

									<h2>Roles</h2>
								</header>
									<p>Mages are often thought of as range magical DPS, while this is not false it is selling the class short. Like most classes mages are able to target their spells and point allocation to forfill the role of tank, melee dps & support. Below are a few build examples:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Range dps build, [class] mage > [ele 1] fire > [ele 2] wind > [skill] Burning tornado (Medium size AoE with chance at fire DoT, can move posistion). Fire DoT and wind casting speed up, and being able to relocate active spells, this build is a generic mage in books/movies/games</li>
										<li>Tank, there are many kinds of mage tanks, but my favourite to date is mage > electric > blood > [adv] sacrificer. This tank makes use of the blood lines "blood drain & aura" skills to continuously replenish their health in exchange for their opponents. They use the sacrificer line to exchange mana for health, and health and mana for boosts. Finally using the electric line to drain back some of the lost mana. This is by no means an ideal mage-tank with it`s high mana cost, reliativly low def to a tank, added to that sacrificing your own hp, but it is really an intresting build.</li>
										<li>Melee dps, mage > fire, a low level build, but sometimes simple is all you need. This mage takes a melee wepon enhances it with fire and ring of fire for an aoe around the caster. The dps from this build comes not only from the melee dammage and fire dammage but also the fire DoT, it can really add up. If you have mana left over fire ball and fire tether can be added into the mix.</li>
										<li>Support, mage > wind > water > weder-derwijes. This build uses wind and water elements to slow down opponents, speed up allies, and provide buffs and debuffs. a weder-derwijes can affect the weather to change the battle ground.</li>
										<li>Support, necromancer, similar to summoners they can create many supporting monsters which can fill any number of roles from tank, to dps, to trash. While not always true summoners tend to summon few powerful monsters and necromancers many weak monsters what makes the necromancer a true support role though is it`s other skills. They can depoloy skills such as skeletal grab, where a skeleton hand would grab at the ankles of the opponent. They also have a wide use of decay debuffs which shorten the duration of buff skills.</li>
