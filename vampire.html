<p><font color="blue">Humans</font> are a common race in Monad. Each race has something that puts it apart from the rest. Humans are the default race in Monad for every player, which makes it easy to take some of the human perks for granted.</p>

<p>Humans inhabit almost every part of the world of Monad where in the majority of those places they make up the majority of the population. Having not too long or too short of a life span, and the ability to reproduce in only 9 months. The human's of Monad have a few specialties that make them stand out and dominate the landscape.</p>

<p>All humans are able to use all simple tools, on the face of it might not sound like much but compared to the other races this gives humans easy access at no cost to all of the available everyday tools even those invented by other races. In game this takes affect from cooking tools, tools for identification of magic items, making and using mana crystals and many more.</p>

<p>Humans have a high bonus charisma stats compared to other races. Unlike races like the vampires where their bonus charisma only effects some races, humans effects all other races they interact with, making them strong team and political players.</p>

<p>Humans have well rounded daytime and night time senses, giving them a slight edge against some other races but not one sense that excels on its own.</p>

<p>Advantages: All stats are very high at night time, giving them a strong nocturnal play style. Vampires have many active and passive skills to help them overcome warm blooded opponents. Vampires have a human like appearance and depending on the type of vampire can maintain this appearance around humans, giving them the opportunity to live among the largest race on the planet and their food source.</p>

<a href="titles.html" target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/city2.jpg" alt="wiki" /></a>

<p>Disadvantages: There are many types of vampires. Some who get stronger from feeding on humans, others who need to feed in order to maintain their human appearance but get stronger when they starve themselves. There are advantages and disadvantages when playing both, but what they both have in common is a need to hide from the humans they feed upon.</p>

<p>Vampires are powerful individuals, who excel at night. However they lack any group skills making them one of the weaker races in a full war. Vampires are well known for being weak in the day time. With some vampires having large reduction to all of their stats in the sun light and others taking burning damage constantly in the sunlight.</p>

<p>
    There are debating theory's on how the vampire race came to be. The majority of humans claim they where once human who was blessed or cursed by an evil God.<br>
    
    The elves claim the vampires are their offspring, as they claim with all the races of Monad. They call vampires the fallen immortal race. (This is not to be confused with the immortal's of past but a bad translation about how elves had long life and are not immortal because the immortality they once had was lost when they made the vampires.)<br>

    The serpentine race claims vampires are a disease, furthermore that the vampire disease can affect more then just the human race, and give examples of other nocturnal creatures such as Wakwak bird. <br>

    A popular tale between vampires is vampires where once residences of the land of Gods, they went into battle and fell to the mortal realm, which is why they have such long lives.

    Vampires can take on different alignments individually, but the majority are on the side of the undead, dark and evil.
